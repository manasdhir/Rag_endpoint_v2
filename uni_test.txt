['Expenses for treating arthritis at home would not be covered under '
 'Domiciliary Hospitalisation Cover because arthritis is specifically listed '
 'as a condition for which the insurer shall not be liable to pay any claim in '
 'connection with Domiciliary Hospitalisation.\n'
 '\n'
 'Additionally, under the "Other Special Conditions," it is explicitly stated '
 'that "Domiciliary Hospitalisation Not Covered."',
 'Based on the provided context:\n'
 '\n'
 '*   **Prosthetic device:** The cost of prosthetic devices implanted during '
 'surgical procedures, such as orthopaedic implants like those for hip '
 'replacement, is payable under "In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses Cover" '
 '(Clause III.A.1.D).\n'
 '*   **Walker:** Walkers are listed as "Not Payable" (List I, item 43) and '
 'are also mentioned under "Specific Exclusions" (Clause IV.C.23) as '
 'non-medical expenses if used at home.\n'
 '*   **Lumbar belt:** A Lumbo Sacral Belt is "Payable for cases who have '
 'undergone surgery of lumbar spine" (List I, item 47). Since the surgery '
 'mentioned is a hip replacement and not explicitly a lumbar spine surgery, '
 "and it's a post-discharge item, it falls under the general non-medical "
 'expense exclusion (Clause IV.C.23) for items subsequently used at home, '
 'meaning it would likely not be payable unless specifically related to lumbar '
 'spine surgery.\n'
 '\n'
 'Therefore, only the **prosthetic device** is payable.',
 "For an insured's child (a dependent above 18 but under 26, unemployed and "
 'unmarried) requiring dental surgery after an accident, the claim '
 'admissibility and process are as follows:\n'
 '\n'
 '**Claim Admissibility:**\n'
 '\n'
 '1.  **Eligibility**: The policy text outlines additions/deletions of '
 'employees and dependents but does not explicitly define the criteria for a '
 '"dependent" child concerning age, employment, or marital status. Assuming '
 "the child meets the policy's unstated definition of a dependent, their "
 'eligibility for coverage would depend on other conditions being met.\n'
 '2.  **Dental Exclusions**: Dental treatment or surgery is generally excluded '
 'unless it is "necessitated due to an Accident and requiring minimum 24 hours '
 'Hospitalisation." Given that the surgery is required due to an accident, it '
 'would be admissible *provided* it necessitates at least 24 hours of '
 'hospitalization. If the dental surgery does not require 24 hours of '
 'hospitalization, it would be excluded.\n'
 '3.  **Waiting Periods**: The policy explicitly states that "Pre-Existing '
 'Disease Waiting Period," "Initial Waiting Period for Hospitalization," and '
 '"Specific Illness Waiting Period" are all "Waived." Therefore, waiting '
 'periods would not affect the admissibility of this claim.\n'
 '\n'
 '**Reimbursement Process for Dental Expenses Cover:**\n'
 '\n'
 '1.  **Submission of Claim**: The Insured Person should send the claim form '
 'provided along with the following documents to the branch office or head '
 'office:\n'
 '    *   Invoices\n'
 "    *   Treating Medical Practitioner's prescription\n"
 '    *   Reports, duly signed by the Insured Person as the case may be.\n'
 '2.  **Assessment of Claim**: The insurer will assess the claim documents to '
 'determine the admissibility of the claim.\n'
 '3.  **Settlement & Repudiation**: Claims, including rejections, will be '
 "settled within 15 days of the receipt of the last 'necessary' document.\n"
 '4.  **Pre-authorization**: The requirement for pre-authorization applies '
 'specifically to Orthodontic Treatment claims for Dependent Children below 18 '
 'years. Since the child in this scenario is above 18, this pre-authorization '
 'requirement does not apply.',
 'Based on the provided context:\n'
 '\n'
 '**Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) expenses:**\n'
 'Expenses incurred on Intra Operative Neuro Monitoring (IONM) will be covered '
 'up to the limit as specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of '
 'Insurance per policy period. Furthermore, according to the "Other Special '
 'Condition Details," 12 Modern treatments as per IRDAI, which would include '
 'IONM, shall be restricted to 50% of the Sum Insured (SI).\n'
 '\n'
 '**ICU care expenses:**\n'
 'Charges for accommodation in ICU/CCU/HDU are covered up to the '
 'category/limit specified in the Policy Schedule/Certificate of Insurance or '
 'actual expenses incurred, whichever is less. Specifically, the "Other '
 'Special Condition Details" state that the Room Rent for ICU (inclusive of '
 'nursing charges) is limited to 4% of the Sum Insured (SI). If the insured is '
 'admitted to a higher category than specified, they will bear the difference '
 'of all medical expenses in the final hospital bill in the same proportion.\n'
 'The context defines a hospital in towns having a population of 1,000,000 or '
 'more as requiring at least 15 in-patient beds, but this does not impose a '
 "specific financial limit on ICU expenses based on the city's population.",
 'To add a newly-adopted child who is 3 years old as a dependent, the '
 'policyholder must make an endorsement request. This request will be assessed '
 'by the underwriter, who may request additional information, documents, or '
 'premium.\n'
 '\n'
 'The circumstances under which the insurer may refuse cover for the child '
 'are:\n'
 '*   **Eligibility:**\n'
 '    *   If neither or both parents are not concurrently covered under the '
 'policy, as children between 91 days and 18 years are covered provided either '
 "or both parents are covered concurrently. (The child's age of 3 years falls "
 'within the eligible range of 91 days and 18 years.)\n'
 '*   **Endorsement Request Assessment:**\n'
 '    *   If the policyholder fails to provide additional information or '
 'documents requested by the underwriter during the assessment of the '
 'endorsement request.\n'
 '    *   If the policyholder fails to pay any additional premium that may be '
 'requested by the underwriter for adding the child.\n'
 '    *   If there is misrepresentation, misdescription, or non-disclosure of '
 'any material fact by the policyholder related to the child or the policy, '
 'which could lead to the policy being void and premium forfeited.',
 'Based on the provided context, here is the claim process for both events:\n'
 '\n'
 '**Event 1: Day Care Cataract Procedure**\n'
 '\n'
 '1.  **Claim Notification Timeline:** Since a cataract procedure is typically '
 'a planned day care treatment, the Insured Person or their representative '
 'shall notify the TPA at least **48 hours prior to admission** in the '
 'hospital.\n'
 '2.  **Claim Process:** Claims for Day Care Treatment are settled on a '
 'reimbursement basis, meaning payment must be made up-front. The Insured '
 'Person should then submit the necessary documents to the TPA within the '
 'prescribed time limit.\n'
 '3.  **Required Documents for Reimbursement:** The claim must be supported '
 'with the following original documents:\n'
 '    *   Duly completed claim form.\n'
 '    *   Photo ID and Age proof.\n'
 '    *   Health Card, policy copy, KYC documents.\n'
 "    *   Attending medical practitioner's / surgeon's certificate regarding "
 'diagnosis/nature of operation performed, along with date of diagnosis, '
 'investigation test reports, and prescription.\n'
 '    *   Medical history of the patient as recorded (all previous '
 'consultation papers indicating history and treatment details for current '
 'ailment).\n'
 '    *   Bills (including break up of charges) and payment receipts duly '
 'supported by the prescription from the attending medical '
 'practitioner/hospital.\n'
 '    *   Discharge certificate/summary from the hospital.\n'
 '    *   Original final Hospital bill with detailed break-up with all '
 'original deposit and final payment receipt.\n'
 '    *   **Original invoice with payment receipt and lens sticker for the '
 'cataract Surgery.**\n'
 '    *   All original diagnostic reports (including imaging and laboratory) '
 "along with Medical Practitioner's prescription and invoice / bill with "
 'receipt from the diagnostic center.\n'
 '    *   All original medicine / pharmacy bills along with the Medical '
 "Practitioner's prescription.\n"
 '    *   Cheque copy with the name of the proposer printed on the cheque leaf '
 'or a copy of the first page of the bank passbook or a bank statement not '
 'later than 3 months old.\n'
 '\n'
 '**Event 2: 5 Days of Inpatient Care in a Non-Network Hospital due to '
 'Complications**\n'
 '\n'
 '1.  **Claim Notification Timeline:** As this arises from complications and '
 'requires emergency inpatient care, the Insured Person or their '
 'representative shall notify the TPA in writing within **24 hours from the '
 "date of emergency hospitalisation required or before the Insured Person's "
 'discharge from Hospital, whichever is earlier.**\n'
 '2.  **Claim Process:** Since the hospitalization is in a non-network '
 'hospital, payment must be made up-front by the Insured Person. For '
 'reimbursement, the Insured Person must then submit the necessary documents '
 'to the TPA within the prescribed time limit.\n'
 '3.  **Required Documents for Reimbursement:** The claim must be supported '
 'with the following original documents:\n'
 '    *   Duly completed claim form.\n'
 '    *   Photo ID and Age proof.\n'
 '    *   Health Card, policy copy, KYC documents.\n'
 "    *   Attending medical practitioner's / surgeon's certificate regarding "
 'diagnosis/nature of operation performed (if any), along with date of '
 'diagnosis, investigation test reports, and prescription.\n'
 '    *   Medical history of the patient as recorded, including all previous '
 'consultation papers indicating history and treatment details for the current '
 'ailment (which would include the link to the previous cataract procedure and '
 'subsequent complications).\n'
 '    *   Bills (including break up of charges) and payment receipts duly '
 'supported by the prescription from the attending medical '
 'practitioner/hospital.\n'
 '    *   Discharge certificate/summary from the hospital.\n'
 '    *   Original final Hospital bill with detailed break-up with all '
 'original deposit and final payment receipt.\n'
 '    *   Original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers for all '
 'implants used during Surgeries (if any were used during this inpatient '
 'stay).\n'
 '    *   All original diagnostic reports (including imaging and laboratory) '
 "along with Medical Practitioner's prescription and invoice / bill with "
 'receipt from the diagnostic center.\n'
 '    *   All original medicine / pharmacy bills along with the Medical '
 "Practitioner's prescription.\n"
 '    *   Cheque copy with the name of the proposer printed on the cheque leaf '
 'or a copy of the first page of the bank passbook or a bank statement not '
 'later than 3 months old.\n'
 '    *   If the complications arose due to an Accident, a copy of the FIR or '
 'medico legal certificate will be required, wherever conducted.\n'
 '\n'
 'For both events, the company may also call for any additional '
 'document/information as required based on the circumstances of the claim if '
 'it is under further investigation or if available documents do not provide '
 'clarity.',
 'Based on the provided context:\n'
 '\n'
 '1.  **Newborn Coverage:** The policy states, "Baby Covered from Day 1 within '
 'Family Sum Insured". This means the newborn is an Insured Person from the '
 "date of birth and their medical expenses are covered under the family's "
 'total Sum Insured.\n'
 '2.  **Maternity Benefit:** While "Maternity Benefit for Normal & C-Section '
 'Covered Limited to INR 50,000 for Normal and INR 50,000 for c-section" '
 "applies to the mother's delivery expenses, the newborn's treatment is "
 'separate and falls under the "Baby Covered from Day 1" clause.\n'
 '3.  **Hospitalization and ICU Treatment:**\n'
 '    *   "Hospitalisation means admission in a Hospital for a minimum period '
 "of 24 consecutive 'In-patient Care' hours except for specified "
 'procedures/treatments, where such admission could be for a period of less '
 'than 24 consecutive hours." While the newborn was admitted for less than 24 '
 'hours, intensive care for a critical condition would typically fall under '
 'these exceptions.\n'
 '    *   "Intensive Care Unit" and "ICU Charges" are defined, implying that '
 'expenses incurred in an ICU are generally covered when medically necessary.\n'
 '    *   "Medical Expenses" are defined as those "necessarily and actually '
 'incurred for medical treatment on account of Illness or Accident on the '
 'advice of a Medical Practitioner".\n'
 '4.  **No Specific Exclusion for Newborn Mortality:** There is no explicit '
 'exclusion in the provided text for medical expenses related to a newborn who '
 'expires shortly after birth, as long as the treatment was medically '
 'necessary.\n'
 '\n'
 "Therefore, the newborn's treatment expenses, including those for intensive "
 'care, would be eligible for a claim from Day 1, covered within the Family '
 'Sum Insured, as long as the treatment was medically necessary and occurred '
 "in an eligible hospital. The specific limit for the mother's C-section "
 "benefit does not apply to the newborn's independent treatment.",
 'Based on the provided context:\n'
 '\n'
 '1.  **Prescription from a general practitioner:** The policy requires a '
 '"treating Medical Practitioner\'s prescription" and "attending medical '
 'practitioner\'s / surgeon\'s certificate regarding diagnosis." A general '
 'practitioner is a Medical Practitioner. Therefore, a prescription from a '
 'general practitioner would generally meet the requirement for a '
 'prescription.\n'
 '\n'
 '2.  **Discharge summary certified by a registered Clinical Psychologist:** '
 'The policy lists "Discharge certificate/ summary from the Hospital" as a '
 'required document. It does not explicitly state who must certify this '
 'summary. However, the policy defines "Treatment" as "any relevant treatment '
 'controlled or administered by a Medical Practitioner." While a "Clinical '
 'Psychologist" is defined as a "Mental Healthcare Professional," a '
 '"Psychiatrist" is specifically defined as a "medical practitioner possessing '
 'a post-graduate degree or diploma in psychiatry."\n'
 '\n'
 '    Therefore, while a Clinical Psychologist can issue or certify documents '
 'related to mental healthcare, the underlying "Treatment" for which the claim '
 'is made must be "controlled or administered by a Medical Practitioner." If '
 'the inpatient psychiatric treatment itself was not primarily controlled or '
 'administered by a "Medical Practitioner" (such as a Psychiatrist) as defined '
 'in the policy, but solely by a Clinical Psychologist, then despite the '
 'submission of the discharge summary, the claim for the "Treatment" might not '
 "be sufficient according to the policy's definition of eligible treatment. "
 'The prescription from a general practitioner covers the initial advice, but '
 'the *inpatient treatment* itself, which leads to the discharge, needs to '
 'align with the "Medical Practitioner" requirement for "Treatment."',
 'Based on the provided context:\n'
 '\n'
 '1.  **Oral Chemotherapy:** Oral Chemotherapy is covered under "Modern '
 'Treatment Methods & Advancement in Technologies" up to the limit specified '
 'in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of Insurance per policy period.\n'
 '\n'
 '2.  **ECG Electrodes and Gloves:**\n'
 '    *   The provided "Permanent Exclusions & Waiting Periods" and "Specific '
 'Exclusions" **do not explicitly list ECG electrodes or gloves as excluded '
 'items.**\n'
 '    *   "Medical Equipment Cover" states that "Prescriptions of treating '
 'Specialist for support items and original invoice of actual Medical Expenses '
 'incurred" are required. ECG electrodes would generally be considered support '
 'items for monitoring during a medical procedure.\n'
 '    *   The exclusion for "non-medical expenses" (Code-Excl23) lists items '
 'such as "ambulatory devices, walker, crutches, belts, collars, splints, '
 'slings, braces, stockings of any kind, diabetic footwear, '
 'glucometer/thermometer and any medical equipment that is subsequently used '
 'at home except when they form part of room expenses." This list primarily '
 'focuses on personal comfort items or equipment for home use, and does not '
 'explicitly include consumables like ECG electrodes or gloves used *during* a '
 'medical session.\n'
 '    *   Given that ECG electrodes are essential for monitoring a patient '
 'during chemotherapy, and gloves are necessary for hygiene and safety during '
 'administration, they would be considered medically necessary components of '
 'the oral chemotherapy session.\n'
 '\n'
 'Therefore, since oral chemotherapy is a covered treatment and ECG electrodes '
 'and gloves are not explicitly excluded and are logically necessary for the '
 'procedure, they would likely be admissible as part of the overall "Medical '
 'Expenses incurred" for the oral chemotherapy sessions, subject to the '
 'overall limit for oral chemotherapy as specified in the Policy Schedule or '
 'Certificate of Insurance and the general requirement for medical necessity '
 'and proper documentation (e.g., invoices).',
 'Based on the provided context:\n'
 '\n'
 '**Pre-hospitalisation expenses (18 days before admission):**\n'
 'These expenses can be claimed under Clause III.A.3, titled "Pre - '
 'hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover." The policy states that such '
 'expenses are covered on a reimbursement basis "up to the number of days and '
 'up to the amount limit as specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of '
 'Insurance." Since the provided context does not specify this number of days, '
 'it cannot be definitively determined if expenses incurred 18 days before '
 'admission fall within the covered period.\n'
 '\n'
 'For these expenses to be covered, the following conditions must be met:\n'
 '1.  A claim for In-patient Hospitalisation under Clause III.A.1 or III.A.2 '
 'must have been accepted.\n'
 '2.  The Pre-hospitalisation Medical Expenses must be related to the same '
 "Illness or Injury for which the Insured Person's Hospitalisation was "
 'required.\n'
 '\n'
 'The claim for these expenses can be made as per the process defined under '
 'Clause VI.4.\n'
 '\n'
 '**Post-hospitalisation expenses (20 days after discharge):**\n'
 'These expenses can be claimed under Clause III.A.4, titled "Post - '
 'hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover." The policy states that such '
 'expenses are covered on a reimbursement basis "up to the number of days and '
 'up to the amount limit as specified in the Policy Schedule or Certificate of '
 'Insurance." Similar to pre-hospitalisation expenses, the provided context '
 'does not specify this number of days, so it cannot be definitively '
 'determined if expenses incurred 20 days after discharge fall within the '
 'covered period.\n'
 '\n'
 'For these expenses to be covered, the following conditions must be met:\n'
 '1.  A claim for In-patient Hospitalisation under Clause III.A.1 or III.A.2 '
 'must have been accepted.\n'
 '2.  Clause III.A.4(ii) states, "The Pre-hospitalisation Medical Expenses are '
 'related to the same Illness or Injury." Logically, within the context of '
 '"Post-hospitalisation Medical Expenses Cover," this condition would apply to '
 'the post-hospitalisation expenses being related to the same illness or '
 'injury for which the in-patient hospitalisation claim was accepted.\n'
 '\n'
 'The claim for these expenses can be made as per the process defined under '
 'Clause VI.4.',
 "According to the policy, an employee/member's child can be covered up to the "
 'age of 26 years, provided they are unmarried, unemployed, and dependent.\n'

 'If a dependent child turns 27 during the policy period, they cease to be an '
 'eligible dependent. In such a scenario, their cover will end when they cease '
 'to be a dependent, unless it has been specifically agreed for their '
 'continuation until the end of the policy period.\n'
 '\n'
 'Upon deletion of an Insured Person, a refund of premium is made on a '

 'For a procedure where the insured opted for a single private room costing '
 'more than the allowed room rent limit:\n'
 '\n'
 '1.  **Specialist Fees:** These are considered "Associated Medical Expenses" '
 '(as per definition B.5) and will be reimbursed in the same proportion as the '
 'admissible rate per day for the room bears to the actual rate per day of the '
 'Room Rent.\n'
 '2.  **Diagnostic Fees:** These are explicitly excluded from the definition '
 'of "Associated Medical Expenses" for the purpose of proportionate deduction '
 '(Definition B.5.c). Therefore, proportionate deductions based on room '
 'category shall not be applied to diagnostic fees, unless differential '
 'billing is adopted for these expenses based on the room category, in which '
 'case the policy states "Proportionate Deductions shall not be applied in '
 'respect of those hospitals where differential billing is not followed or for '
 'those expenses where differential billing is not adopted based on the room '
 'category."\n'
 '\n'
 'The relevant clause is **Note 1: Proportionate Clause** under Clause '
 'III.A.1, in conjunction with **Definition B.5: Associated Medical '
 'Expenses**.',
 'If a claim is partially rejected due to a lack of required documentation, '
 'the following course of action is applicable:\n'
 '\n'
 '1.  **Notification of Deficiency:** The company or TPA will scrutinize the '
 'claim documents. Any deficiency in the documents will be intimated to the '
 'Insured Person.\n'
 '2.  **Consequences of Late Resubmission:** If the deficiency in the '
 'necessary claim documents is not met or is partially met within 10 working '
 'days of the first intimation, the company will send a maximum of three '
 'reminders. At its sole discretion, the company may decide to deduct the '
 'amount of the claim for which the deficiency was intimated and settle the '
 'claim if it is otherwise deemed valid under the Policy.\n'
 '3.  **Final Rejection Communication:** If the company decides to fully '
 'reject the claim for any reason, it will communicate this decision to the '
 'insured person in writing, explicitly mentioning the grounds for '
 'rejection/repudiation. This communication will occur within 15 days from the '
 'receipt of the final document(s) or investigation report (if any).\n'
 '4.  **Contesting the Rejection (Reconsideration):** If the Insured Person '
 'wishes to contest the final rejection, they may represent to the company for '
 'reconsideration of the decision within 15 days from the date of receipt of '
 'the claims decision.\n'
 '5.  **Grievance Procedures (if reconsideration is unsatisfactory):** If the '
 'Insured Person is not satisfied with the reconsideration outcome, they can '
 'contact the company through various grievance channels:\n'
 '    *   Website: www.uiic.co.in\n'
 '    *   Toll-free number: 1800 425 333 33\n'

 '6.  **Further Grievance Redressal:** If still not satisfied with the '
 "redressal through the company's channels, the Insured Person may approach "
 'the office of the Insurance Ombudsman of the respective area/region as per '
 'Insurance Ombudsman Rules 2017, or lodge a grievance at the IRDAI Integrated '

 'The context for "Hospitalisation" (Point 17) states that admission is for a '
 'minimum period of 24 consecutive \'In-patient Care\' hours, "except for '
 'specified procedures/treatments, where such admission could be for a period '
 'of less than 24 consecutive hours."\n'
 '\n'

 'the Policy Period provided the Day Care Treatment is for Medically Necessary '
 'Treatment and follows the written Medical Advice."\n'

 'documentation necessary for adding the requested individuals mid-policy:\n'
 '\n'
 '**1. New Employee:**\n'
 '*   **Eligibility:** The individual must be a newly appointed employee of '
 'the policyholder.\n'
 '*   **Documentation/Process:** The Policyholder must provide written '
 'notification specifying the details of the new employee to be added. An '
 'application for cover is also required to be accepted by the insurer. '

 'unmarried, unemployed, and dependent.\n'
 '*   **Mid-Policy Addition:** The context does **not** state that a sibling '
 'can be added mid-policy. The section detailing "Additions" during the policy '
 'period for an Employer-Employee Group specifically lists only "Newly '
 'appointed employee and his/her dependents," "Newly wedded spouse of the '

 'If an accident necessitates air ambulance evacuation with subsequent '
 'inpatient admission, the following steps must be followed for both '
 'pre-authorization and claims assessment:\n'
 '\n'
 '**1. Pre-authorization:**\n'
 '\n'
 '*   **For Emergency Evacuation (including Air Ambulance):** The Insured '
 'Person must notify the company immediately, either at their call center or '
 'in writing. Emergency medical evacuations require pre-authorization from the '
 'company. A team of specialists, in association with the emergency assistance '
 'service provider, will determine the medical necessity of such evacuation '
 'before approval.\n'
 '*   **For Emergency Hospitalisation:** The insured person or their '
 'representative must notify the TPA in writing within 24 hours from the date '
 "of emergency hospitalisation or before the Insured Person's discharge from "
 'the Hospital, whichever is earlier.\n'
 '*   **For Cashless Facility (for In-patient Hospitalisation):**\n'
 '    *   The cashless facility is subject to pre-authorization by the TPA.\n'
 '    *   Treatment must be taken in a network provider/PPN hospital.\n'
 "    *   The customer may call the TPA's toll-free phone number for claim "
 'intimation and assistance, keeping their ID number handy.\n'
 '    *   Upon admission, produce the ID card issued by the TPA at the '
 'Hospital Insurance-desk.\n'
 '    *   Complete the cashless request form (available at the network '
 'provider/PPN and TPA) and send it to the TPA for pre-authorization.\n'
 '    *   The TPA will issue a pre-authorization letter to the hospital after '
 'verifying the cashless request form and related medical information.\n'
 '    *   Once granted, the treatment must take place within 15 days of the '
 'pre-authorization date, and all details must match the actual treatment '
 'received.\n'
 "    *   If there's any change in diagnosis, plan of treatment, or cost "
 'during hospitalisation, the Network Provider must obtain a fresh '
 'authorization letter.\n'
 '    *   The TPA reserves the right to deny pre-authorization if relevant '
 'medical details are not provided. However, denial of pre-authorization is '
 'not a denial of treatment or coverage; the Insured Person can get treatment '
 'and submit documents for reimbursement.\n'
 '\n'
 '**2. Claims Assessment (Documentation for Reimbursement):**\n'
 '\n'
 'If payment is made upfront (e.g., in non-network hospitals, if cashless is '
 'denied, or for elements like air ambulance which are typically reimbursed), '
 'the insured person must submit the necessary documents to the TPA within the '

 'For a specific illness like knee replacement due to osteoarthritis, if the '
 'insured person had prior continuous coverage under a different insurer and '
 'ported to this policy, the waiting period would be treated as follows:\n'
 '\n'
 '1.  **Applicable Waiting Periods:**\n'
 '    *   Knee Replacement Surgery (other than caused by an Accident) and '
 'Osteoarthritis are listed under the **Specific Waiting Period '
 '(Code-Excl02)**.\n'
 '    *   If the osteoarthritis was a pre-existing condition, it would also '
 'fall under the **Pre-Existing Disease Waiting Period (Code-Excl01)**.\n'
 '\n'
 '2.  **Longer of the Two:** If the specified disease/procedure (knee '
 'replacement due to osteoarthritis) falls under both the Specific Waiting '
 'Period and the Pre-Existing Disease Waiting Period, then the longer of the '
 'two waiting periods shall apply.\n'
 '\n'
 '3.  **Portability Benefit:**\n'
 '    *   **For Pre-Existing Disease Waiting Period:** If the Insured Person '
 'is continuously covered without any break as defined under the portability '
 'norms of the extant IRDAI (Insurance Product) Regulations 2024, then the '
 'waiting period for the same would be reduced to the extent of prior '
 'coverage.\n'
 '    *   **For Specific Waiting Period:** If the Insured Person is '
 'continuously covered without any break as defined under the applicable norms '
 'on portability stipulated by IRDAI, then the waiting period for the same '
 'would be reduced to the extent of prior coverage.\n'
 '\n'
 'In essence, the policy will apply the longer of the two relevant waiting '
 'periods (pre-existing disease or specific waiting period for knee '
 'replacement/osteoarthritis), but this waiting period will be reduced by the '
 "duration of the insured's prior continuous coverage under the previous "
 'insurer, provided the portability norms were followed without any break in '
 'coverage.',
 'The policy does not contain a specific exclusion for "imported medication." '
 'However, the expense for an imported medication, even if prescribed as part '
 'of inpatient treatment, would be covered if it meets the criteria for '
 '"Medically Necessary Treatment" (Clause 27) and is not categorized as '
 '"Unproven Treatments" (Code-Excl16).\n'
 '\n'
 'Based on the context:\n'
 '\n'
 '*   **Medically Necessary Treatment (Clause 27):**\n'
 '    *   It must have been prescribed by a medical practitioner (Clause '
 '27.iii).\n'
 '    *   It must conform to the professional standards widely accepted in '
 'international medical practice or by the medical community in India (Clause '
 '27.iv). This is crucial for an imported medication.\n'
 '    *   It must be required for the medical management of the illness or '
 'injury (Clause 27.i) and not exceed the necessary level of care (Clause '
 '27.ii).\n'
 '*   **Unproven Treatments (Code-Excl16):** Expenses related to any unproven '
 'treatment are excluded. Unproven treatments are defined as "treatments, '
 'procedures or supplies that lack significant medical documentation to '
 'support their effectiveness."\n'
 '*   **General exclusions related to treatment and charges (Clause C.7):** '
 'Any treatment or part of a treatment that is not of a reasonable charge, or '
 'is not a Medically Necessary Treatment, or drugs/treatments not supported by '
 'a prescription are not covered.\n'
 '\n'
 'Therefore, if the imported medication is prescribed by a medical '
 'practitioner, is considered medically necessary, conforms to accepted '
 'professional standards in India or internationally, has significant medical '
 'documentation to support its effectiveness (i.e., not unproven), and is of a '
 'reasonable charge, it would likely be covered.',
 "For a non-employer group policy, in the event of a member's death, the "
 'specifics regarding the coverage of their dependents and options for '

 'For claims involving implanted devices such as lenses in cataract surgery or '
 'stents in angioplasty surgery, the required supporting documentation '
 'includes the original invoice with payment receipt and **implant stickers** '
 'for all implants used during the surgeries.\n'
 '\n'
 'If only a generic invoice without the implant sticker is provided, the claim '
 'may be subject to further investigation because the available documents '
 'would not provide clarity. The company or its representatives may call for '
 'additional documents or information to assess their liability and the '
 'quantum of the claim. The claim must be supported by the required original '
 'documents for assessment and determination of admissibility.',
 'For home nursing charges to qualify for reimbursement, the "Home Nursing '
 'Charges Cover" must have been opted for as an optional cover.\n'
 '\n'
 'The following documentation would be needed for reimbursement:\n'
 '\n'
 '**Specific to Home Nursing Charges Cover:**\n'
 '*   Bills from a registered nursing service provider.\n'

 '*   Discharge certificate/summary from the hospital.\n'
 '*   Original final Hospital bill with detailed break-up with all original '
 'deposit and final payment receipt.\n'
 '*   Original invoice with payment receipt and implant stickers for any '
 'implants used during Surgeries (if applicable).\n'
 '*   All original diagnostic reports (including imaging and laboratory) along '
 "with Medical Practitioner's prescription and invoice / bill with receipt "

 '*   Cheque copy with name of proposer printed on the cheque leaf or copy of '

 '\n'
 'Additionally, the company may call for any additional document/information '
 'if the claim is under further investigation or available documents do not '
 'provide clarity. The bills/invoices/medical treatment related documents must '
 "be in the Insured Person's name. The claim intimation must have been made "

 'In a multi-policy scenario, if the available coverage under the primary '
 'policy is less than the admissible claim amount, the following procedure '
 'applies:\n'
 '\n'
 '1.  **Claim Filing:** The Insured Person can file for claim settlement under '
 'any chosen policy, and the insurer of that chosen policy will be treated as '
 'the primary Insurer.\n'
 "2.  **Coordination for Balance Amount:** If the primary policy's coverage is "
 'insufficient, the primary Insurer will seek details of other available '
 'policies of the policyholder and coordinate with other Insurers to ensure '
 'the settlement of the balance amount.\n'
 '3.  **Required Documentation:** This coordination and settlement of the '
 'balance amount will occur provided a written request for the same has been '
 'submitted by the Insured Person.',
 "Based on the provided context, if the insured's hospitalization was solely "
 'for evaluation and all tests and imaging were negative, leading to a '
 'decision for no treatment, these expenses would likely **not be '
 'claimable**.\n'
 '\n'
 "Here's why, using the definitions and exclusions:\n"
 '\n'
 '1.  **In-patient Hospitalisation Expenses Cover (Clause III.A.1):** This '
 'section states that coverage is for "Medical Expenses of an Insured Person '
 'in case of Medically Necessary Treatment taken during Hospitalisation." '
 'While point G covers "Cost of Investigative tests or diagnostic procedures '
 'directly related to the Injury/Illness for which the Insured Person is '
 'hospitalised," the overarching condition is that they are part of "Medically '
 'Necessary Treatment."\n'
 '\n'
 '2.  **Definition of Medically Necessary Treatment (Clause II.A.27):** This '
 'definition includes "any treatment, tests, medication, or stay in hospital '
 'or part of a stay in hospital which: i. is required for the medical '
 'management of the illness or injury suffered by the insured." If the tests '
 'are negative and no illness or injury requiring "medical management" is '
 'found, then the stay might not meet this criterion.\n'
 '\n'
 '3.  **Specific Exclusion (Clause IV.C.16):** This exclusion directly '
 'addresses such a scenario: "Any stay in Hospital without undertaking any '
 'Treatment or any other purpose other than for receiving eligible Treatment '
 'of a type that normally requires a stay in the Hospital." If the evaluation '
 'revealed no condition requiring treatment, the hospital stay would fall '
 'under this exclusion.\n'
 '\n'
 'Therefore, even though diagnostic tests are listed as covered expenses, the '
 'context specifies that they must be incurred as part of "Medically Necessary '
 'Treatment." A hospitalization resulting in all negative tests and no '
 "subsequent treatment would not align with the policy's requirement for "
 '"Medically Necessary Treatment" and would likely be excluded as a "stay in '
 'Hospital without undertaking any Treatment."',
 'In the event of the sudden demise of a previous nominee and in the absence '
 'of any prior endorsement for a nominee change, the policy states that if '
 'there is no subsisting nominee, the company will pay the claim to the legal '
 'heirs or legal representatives of the policyholder. The discharge given by '
 'these legal heirs or representatives will be considered a full and final '
 "discharge of the company's liability under the policy.\n"
 '\n'
 'Any change of nomination must be communicated to the company in writing and '
 'becomes effective only when an endorsement on the policy is made.',
 'Based on the provided context, prostheses or medical appliances are *not* '
 'covered in the following scenarios, even if associated with '
 'hospitalization:\n'
 '\n'
 '1.  **If they are not required intra-operatively for the specific illness or '
 'injury for which the Insured Person was hospitalized.** (C.19)\n'
 '2.  **If they are considered non-medical expenses primarily for personal '
 'comfort and are not consistent with or incidental to the diagnosis and '
 'treatment of the illness/injury for which the Insured Person was '
 'hospitalized.** This also applies if the equipment is subsequently used at '
 'home, unless it forms part of room expenses. (C.23)\n'
 '    *   Examples of such items explicitly listed as non-medical expenses '
 'include: ambulatory devices, walkers, crutches, belts, collars, splints, '
 'slings, braces, stockings of any kind, diabetic footwear, '
 'glucometers/thermometers, and any medical equipment subsequently used at '
 'home (unless part of room expenses).',
 'Based on the context provided, it is **unlikely** that the expenses would be '
 'reimbursed.\n'
 '\n'
 'The reason is that the definition of an "AYUSH Day Care Centre" (Clause '
 'II.A.3) explicitly states that it must be "registered with the local '
 'authorities, wherever applicable." While the context does not explicitly '
 'define an "AYUSH Hospital" or its registration requirements, it is logical '
 'to infer that if a Day Care Centre requires local registration for its '
 'services to be covered, an AYUSH hospital providing inpatient care would '
 'also be expected to be registered with local authorities for expenses to be '
 'reimbursed under the policy. The policy implicitly covers treatment in '
 'established and recognized facilities.',
 "If the insured's treatment plan changes during hospitalization, leading to a "
 'change in diagnosis, treatment plan, or cost, the Network Provider must '
 'obtain a fresh authorization letter from the Company (Us) in accordance with '
 'the pre-authorization process.',
 'Claims for pre-hospitalization expenses are processed only after a decision '
 'has been made on the main hospitalization claim. The policy states that for '
 'pre-hospitalization medical expenses to be covered, a claim for In-patient '
 'Hospitalisation must first be accepted.',

 'The contact telephone numbers (office/residence), fax, and email address for '
 'the policyholder are not provided in the given context.',
 'Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a process for '
 'automatically approving all claims. Instead, the document outlines a '
 'detailed procedure for claims administration, requiring submission of '
