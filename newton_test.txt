  '### DEFINITION I.\n'
  '\n'
  'The quantity of matter is the measure of the same, arising from its\n'
  'density and bulk conjunctly.\n'
  '\n'
  'THUS air of a double density, in a double space, is quadruple in quan-\n'
  'tity ; in a triple space, sextuple in quantity. The same thing is to be '
  'un-\n'
  'derstood of snow, and fine dust or powders, that are condensed by compres-\n'
  'sion or liquefaction ; and of all bodies that are by any causes whatever\n'
  'differently condensed. I have no regard in this place to a medium, if any\n'
  'such there is, that freely pervades the interstices between the parts of\n'
  'bodies. It is this quantity that I mean hereafter everywhere under the\n'
  'name of body or mass. And the same is known by the weight of each\n'
  'body ; for it is proportional to the weight, as I have found by '
  'experiments\n'
  'on pendulums, very accurately made, which shall be shewn hereafter.\n'
  '\n'
  '\n'
  '### DEFINITION II.\n'
  '\n'
  'The quantity of motion is the measure of the same. arising from the\n'
  'velocity and quantity of matter conjunctly.\n'
  '\n'
  'The motion of the whole is the sum of the motions of all the parts; and\n'
  'therefore in a body double in quantity, with equal velocity, the motion is\n'
  'double; with twice the velocity, it is quadruple.\n'
  '\n'
  '\n'
  '### DEFINITION III.\n'
  '\n'
  'The vis insita, or innate force of matter, is a power of resisting, by\n'
  'which every body, as much as in it lies, endeavours to persevere in its\n'
  'present state, whether it be of rest, or of moving uniformly forward\n'
  'in a right line.\n'
  '\n'
  'This force is ever proportional to the body whose force it is; and differs\n'
  'nothing from the inactivity of the mass, but in our manner of conceiving\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageBreak -->\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageNumber="74" -->\n'
  '<!-- PageHeader="THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES" -->\n'
  '\n'
  'it. A body, from the inactivity of matter, is not without difficulty put '
  'out\n'
  'of its state of rest or motion. Upon which account, this vis insita, may,\n'
  'by a most significant name, be called vis inertia, or force of inactivity.\n'
  'But a body exerts this force only, when another force, impressed upon it,\n'
  'endeavours to change its condition ; and the exercise of this force may be\n'
  'considered both as resistance and impulse ; it is resistance, in so far as '
  'the\n'
  'body, for maintaining its present state, withstands the force impressed ; '
  'it\n'
  'is impulse, in so far as the body, by not easily giving way to the '
  'impressed\n'
  'force of another, endeavours to change the state of that other. Resistance\n'
  'is usually ascribed to bodies at rest, and impulse to those in motion ;\n'
  'but motion and rest, as commonly conceived, are only relatively distin-\n'
  'guished ; nor are those bodies always truly at rest, which commonly are\n'
  'taken to be so.\n'
  '\n'
  '\n'
  '### DEFINITION IV.\n'
  '\n'
  'An impressed force is an action exerted upon a body, in order to change\n'
  'its state, either of rest, or of moving uniformly forward in a right\n'
  'line.\n'
  '\n'
  'This force consists in the action only; and remains no longer in the\n'
  'body, when the action is over. For a body maintains every new state it\n'
  'acquires, by its vis inertia only. Impressed forces are of different '
  'origins .\n'
  'as from percussion, from pressure, from centripetal force.\n'
  '\n'
  '\n'
  '### DEFINITION V.\n'
  '\n'
  'A centripetal force is that by which bodies are drawn or impelled, or any\n'
  'way tend, towards a point as to a centre.\n'
  '\n'
  'Of this sort is gravity, by which bodies tend to the centre of the earth\n'
  'magnetism, by which iron tends to the loadstone; and that force, what\n'
  'ever it is, by which the planets are perpetually drawn aside from the rec-\n'
  'tilinear motions, which otherwise they would pursue, and made to revolve\n'
  'in curvilinear orbits. A stone, whirled about in a sling, endeavours to '
  're-\n'
  'cede from the hand that turns it; and by that endeavour, distends the\n'
  'sling, and that with so much the greater force, as it is revolved with the\n'
  'greater velocity, and as soon as ever it is let go, flies away. That force\n'
  'which opposes itself to this endeavour, and by which the sling perpetually\n'
  'draws back the stone towards the hand, and retains it in its orbit, '
  'because\n'
  'it is directed to the hand as the centre of the orbit, I call the '
  'centripetal\n'
  'force. And the same thing is to be understood of all bodies, revolved in\n'
  "any orbits. 'They all endeavour to recede from the centres of their orbits "
  ';\n'
  'and were it not for the opposition of a contrary force which restrains '
  'them\n'
  'to, and detains them in their orbits, which I therefore call centripetal, '
  'would\n'
  'fly off in right lines, with an uniform motion. A projectile, if it was '
  'not\n'
  'for the force of gravity, would not deviate towards the earth, but would\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageBreak -->\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageNumber="75" -->\n'
  '<!-- PageHeader="OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY." -->\n'
  '\n'
  'go off from it in a right line, and that with an uniform motion, if the '
  're-\n'
  'sistance of the air was taken away. It is by its gravity that it is drawn\n'
  'aside perpetually from its rectilinear course, and made to deviate towards\n'
  'the earth, more or less, according to the force of its gravity, and the '
  'velo-\n'
  'city of its motion. The less its gravity is, for the quantity of its '
  'matter,\n'
  'or the greater the velocity with which it is projected, the less will it '
  'devi-\n'
  'ate from a rectilinear course, and the farther it will go. If a leaden '
  'ball,\n'
  'projected from the top of a mountain by the force of gunpowder with a\n'
  'given velocity, and in a direction parallel to the horizon, is carried in '
  'a\n'
  'curve line to the distance of two miles before it falls to the ground ; '
  'the\n'
  'same, if the resistance of the air were taken away, with a double or '
  'decuple\n'
  'velocity, would fly twice or ten times as far. And by increasing the velo-\n'
  'city, we may at pleasure increase the distance to which it might be pro-\n'
  'jected, and diminish the curvature of the line, which it might describe, '
  'till\n'
  'at last it should fall at the distance of 10, 30, or 90 degrees, or even '
  'might\n'
  'go quite round the whole earth before it falls; or lastly, so that it '
  'might\n'
  'never fall to the earth, but go forward into the celestial spaces, and '
  'pro-\n'
  'ceed in its motion in infinitum. And after the same manner that a pro-\n'
  'jectile, by the force of gravity, may be made to revolve in an orbit, and '
  'go\n'
  'round the whole earth, the moon also, either by the force of gravity, if '
  'it\n',
  'is endued with gravity, or by any other force, that impels it towards the\n'
  'earth, may be perpetually drawn aside towards the earth, out of the recti-\n'
  'linear way, which by its innate force it would pursue; and would be made\n'
  'to revolve in the orbit which it now describes ; nor could the moon with-\n'
  'out some such force, be retained in its orbit. If this force was too '
  'small,\n'
  'it would not sufficiently turn the moon out of a rectilinear course: if it\n'
  'was too great, it would turn it too much, and draw down the moon from\n'
  'its orbit towards the earth. It is necessary, that the force be of a just\n'
  'quantity, and it belongs to the mathematicians to find the force, that may\n'
  'serve exactly to retain a body in a given orbit, with a given velocity ; '
  'and\n'
  'vice versa, to determine the curvilinear way, into which a body projected\n'
  'from a given place, with a given velocity, may be made to deviate from\n'
  'its natural rectilinear way, by means of a given force.\n'
  '\n'
  'The quantity of any centripetal force may be considered as of three\n'
  'kinds; absolute, accelerative, and motive.\n'
  '\n'
  '\n'
  '### DEFINITION VI.\n'
  '\n'
  'The absolute quantity of a centripetal force is the measure of the same\n'
  'proportional to the efficacy of the cause that propagates it from the cen-\n'
  'tre, through the spaces round about.\n'
  '\n'
  'Thus the magnetic force is greater in one load-stone and less in another\n'
  'according to their sizes and strength of intensity.\n'
  '\n'

  '\n'
  '<!-- PageNumber="76" -->\n'
  '<!-- PageHeader="THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES" -->\n'
  '\n'
  '\n'
  '### DEFINITION VII.\n'
  '\n'
  'The accelerative quantity of a centripetal force is the measure of the\n'
  'same, proportional to the velocity which it generates in a given time.\n'
  '\n'
  'Thus the force of the same load-stone is greater at a less distance, and\n'
  'less at a greater : also the force of gravity is greater in valleys, less '
  'on\n'
  'tops of exceeding high mountains ; and yet less (as shall hereafter be '
  'shown),\n'
  'at greater distances from the body of the earth; but at equal distan-\n'
  'ces, it is the same everywhere; because (taking away, or allowing for, the\n'
  'resistance of the air), it equally accelerates all falling bodies, whether '
  'heavy\n'
  'or light, great or small.\n'
  '\n'
  '\n'
  '### DEFINITION VIII.\n'
  '\n'
  'The motive quantity of a centripetal force, is the measure of the same;\n'
  'proportional to the motion which it generates in a given time.\n'
  '\n'
  'Thus the weight is greater in a greater body, less in a less body ; and,\n'
  'in the same body, it is greater near to the earth, and less at remoter '
  'dis-\n'
  'tances. This sort of quantity is the centripetency, or propension of the\n'
  'whole body towards the centre, or, as I may say, its weight ; and it is '
  'al-\n'
  'ways known by the quantity of an equal and contrary force just sufficient\n'
  'to binder the descent of the body.\n'
  '\n'
  "'These quantities of forces, we may, for brevity's sake, call by the names\n"
  "of motive, accelerative, and absolute forces ; and, for distinction's sake, "
  'con-\n'
  'sider them, with respect to the bodies that tend to the centre; to the '
  'places\n'
  'of those bodies ; and to the centre of force towards which they tend ; '
  'that\n'
  'is to say, I refer the motive force to the body as an endeavour and '
  'propen-\n'
  'sity of the whole towards a centre, arising from the propensities of the\n'
  'several parts taken together; the accelerative force to the place of the\n'
  'body, as a certain power or energy diffused from the centre to all places\n'
  'around to move the bodies that are in them; and the absolute force to\n'
  'the centre, as endued with some cause, without which those motive forces\n'
  'would not be propagated through the spaces round about; whether that\n'
  'cause be some central body (such as is the load-stone, in the centre of '
  'the\n'
  'magnetic force, or the earth in the centre of the gravitating force), or\n'
  'anything else that does not yet appear. For I here design only to give a\n'
  'mathematical notion of those forces, without considering their physical\n'
  'causes and seats.\n'
  '\n'
  'Wherefore the accelerative force will stand in the same relation to the\n'
  'motive, as celerity does to motion. For the quantity of motion arises from\n'
  'the celerity drawn into the quantity of matter ; and the motive force '
  'arises\n'
  'from the accelerative force drawn into the same quantity of matter. For\n'
  'the sum of the actions of the accelerative force, upon the several ; '
  'articles\n'
  'of the body, is the motive force of the whole. Hence it is, that near the\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageBreak -->\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageHeader="OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY." -->\n'
  '\n'
  'surface of the earth, where the accelerative gravity, or force productive '
  'of\n'
  'gravity, in all bodies is the same, the motive gravity or the weight is as\n'
  'the body : but if we should ascend to higher regions, where the '
  'accelerative\n'
  'gravity is less, the weight would be equally diminished, and would always\n'
  'be as the product of the body, by the accelerative gravity. So in those '
  're-\n'
  'gions, where the accelerative gravity is diminished into one half, the '
  'weight\n'
  'of a body two or three times less, will be four or six times less.\n'
  '\n'
  'I likewise call attractions and impulses, in the same sense, accelerative,\n'
  'and motive; and use the words attraction, impulse or propensity of any\n'
  'sort towards a centre, promiscuously, and indifferently, one for another ;\n'
  'considering those forces not physically, but mathematically : wherefore, '
  'the\n'
  'reader is not to imagine, that by those words, I anywhere take upon me to\n'
  'define the kind, or the manner of any action, the causes or the physical\n'
  'reason thereof, or that I attribute forces, in a true and physical sense, '
  'to\n'
  'certain centres (which are only mathematical points) ; when at any time I\n'
  'happen to speak of centres as attracting, or as endued with attractive\n'
  'powers.\n'
  '\n'
  '\n'
  '## SCHOLIUM.\n'
  '\n'
  'Hitherto I have laid down the definitions of such words as are less\n'
  'known, and explained the sense in which I would have them to be under-\n'
  'stood in the following discourse. I do not define time, space, place and\n'
  'motion, as being well known to all. Only I must observe, that the vulgar\n'
  'conceive those quantities under no other notions but from the relation '
  'they\n'
  'bear to sensible objects. And thence arise certain prejudices, for the re-\n'
  'moving of which, it will be convenient to distinguish them into absolute\n'
  'and relative, true and apparent, mathematical and common.\n'
  '\n'
  'I. Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own na-\n'
  'ture flows equably without regard to anything external, and by another\n'
  'name is called duration : relative, apparent, and common time, is some '
  'sen-\n'
  'sible and external (whether accurate or unequable) measure of duration by\n'
  'the means of motion, which is commonly used instead of true time; such\n'
  'as an hour, a day, a month, a year.\n'
  '\n'
  'II. Absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything exter-\n'
  'nal, remains always similar and immovable. Relative space is some mo-\n'
  'vable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces; which our senses de-\n'
  'termine by its position to bodies ; and which is vulgarly taken for immo-\n'
  'vable space; such is the dimension of a subterraneous, an æreal, or '
  'celestial\n'
  'space, determined by its position in respect of the earth. Absolute and\n'
  'relative space, are the same in figure and magnitude ; but they do not re-\n'
  'main always numerically the same. For if the earth, for instance, moves,\n'
  'a space of our air, which relatively and in respect of the earth remains '
  'al-\n'
  'ways the same, will at one time be one part of the absolute space into '
  'which\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageBreak -->\n',
  '\n'
  'A property, near akin to the preceding, is this, that if a place is moved,\n'
  'whatever is placed therein moves along with it; and therefore a body,\n'
  'which is moved from a place in motion, partakes also of the motion of its\n'
  'place. Upon which account, all motions, from places in motion, are no\n'
  'other than parts of entire and absolute motions; and every entire motion\n'
  'is composed of the motion of the body out of its first place, and the\n'
  'motion of this place out of its place ; and so on, until we come to some\n'
  'immovable place, as in the before-mentioned example of the sailor. Where-\n'
  'fore, entire and absolute motions can be no otherwise determined than by\n'
  'immovable places; and for that reason I did before refer those absolute\n'
  'motions to immovable places, but relative ones to movable places. Now\n'
  'no other places are immovable but those that, from infinity to infinity, '
  'do\n'
  'all retain the same given position one to another ; and upon this account\n'
  'must ever remain unmoved ; and do thereby constitute immovable space.\n'
  '\n'
  'The causes by which true and relative motions are distinguished, one\n'
  'from the other, are the forces impressed upon bodies to generate motion.\n'
  "'True motion is neither gencrated nor altered, but by some force impressed\n"
  'upon the body moved; but relative motion may be generated or altered\n'
  'without any force impressed upon the body. For it is sufficient only to\n'
  'impress some force on other bodies with which the former is compared,\n'
  'that by their giving way, that relation may be changed, in which the re-\n'
  'lative rest or motion of this other body did consist. Again, true motion\n'
  'suffers always some change from any force impressed upon the moving\n'
  'body ; but relative motion does not necessarily undergo any change by such\n'
  'forces. For if the same forces are likewise impressed on those other '
  'bodies,\n'
  'with which the comparison is made, that the relative position may be pre-\n'
  'served, then that condition will be preserved in which the relative motion\n'
  'consists. And therefore any relative motion may be changed when the\n'
  'true motion remains unaltered, and the relative may be preserved when the\n'
  'true suffers some change. Upon which accounts, true motion does by no\n'
  'means consist in such relations.\n'
  '\n'
  'The effects which distinguish absolute from relative motion are, the\n'
  'forces of receding from the axis of circular motion. For there are no such\n'
  'forces in a circular motion purely relative, but in a true and absolute '
  'cir-\n'
  'cular motion, they are greater or less, according to the quantity of the\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageBreak -->\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageNumber="81" -->\n'
  '<!-- PageHeader="OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY." -->\n'
  '\n'
  'motion. If a vessel, hung by a long cord, is so often turned about that '
  'the\n'
  'cord is strongly twisted, then filled with water, and held at rest '
  'together\n'
  'with the water; after, by the sudden action of another force, it is '
  'whirled\n'
  'about the contrary way, and while the cord is untwisting itself, the '
  'vessel\n'
  'continues for some time in this motion ; the surface of the water will at\n'
  'first be plain, as before the vessel began to move; but the vessel, by '
  'grad-\n'
  'ually communicating its motion to the water, will make it begin sensibly\n'
  'to revolve, and recede by little and little from the middle, and ascend to '
  'the\n'
  'sides of the vessel, forming itself into a concave figure (as I have '
  'experi-\n'
  'enced), and the swifter the motion becomes, the higher will the water '
  'rise,\n'
  'till at last, performing its revolutions in the same times with the '
  'vessel,\n'
  'it becomes relatively at rest in it. This ascent of the water shows its '
  'en-\n'
  'deavour to recede from the axis of its motion; and the true and absolute\n'
  'circular motion of the water, which is here directly contrary to the rela-\n'
  'tive, discovers itself, and may be measured by this endeavour. At first,\n'
  'when the relative motion of the water in the vessel was greatest, it pro-\n'
  'duced no endeavour to recede from the axis ; the water showed no tendency\n'
  'to the circumference, nor any ascent towards the sides of the vessel, but\n'
  'remained of a plain surface, and therefore its true circular motion had '
  'not\n'
  'yet begun. But afterwards, when the relative motion of the water had\n'
  'decreased, the ascent thereof towards the sides of the vessel proved its '
  'en-\n'
  'deavour to recede from the axis; and this endeavour showed the real cir-\n'
  'cular motion of the water perpetually increasing, till it had acquired its\n'
  'greatest quantity, when the water rested relatively in the vessel. And\n'
  'therefore this endeavour does not depend upon any translation of the water\n'
  'in respect of the ambient bodies, nor can true circular motion be defined\n'
  'by such translation. There is only one real circular motion of any one\n'
  'revolving body, corresponding to only one power of endeavouring to recede\n'
  'from its axis of motion, as its proper and adequate effect ; but relative\n'
  'motions, in one and the same body, are innumerable, according to the '
  'various\n'
  'relations it bears to external bodies, and like other relations, are '
  'altogether\n'
  'destitute of any real effect, any otherwise than they may perhaps par-\n'
  'take of that one only true motion. And therefore in their system who\n'
  'suppose that our heavens, revolving below the sphere of the fixed stars,\n'
  'carry the planets along with them ; the several parts of those heavens, '
  'and\n'
  'the planets, which are indeed relatively at rest in their heavens, do yet\n'
  'really move. For they change their position one to another (which never\n'
  'happens to bodies truly at rest), and being carried together with their\n'
  'heavens, partake of their motions, and as parts of revolving wholes,\n'
  'endeavour to recede from the axis of their motions.\n'
  '\n'
  'Wherefore relative quantities are not the quantities themselves, whose\n'
  'names they bear, but those sensible measures of them (either accurate er\n'
  'inaccurate), which are commonly used instead of the measured quantities\n'
  'themselves. And if the meaning of words is to be determined by their\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageBreak -->\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageNumber="82" -->\n'
  '<!-- PageHeader="THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES" -->\n'
  '\n'
  'use, then by the names time, space, place and motion, their measures arv\n'
  'properly to be understood; and the expression will be unusual, and purely\n'
  'mathematical, if the measured quantities themselves are meant. Upon\n'
  'which account, they do strain the sacred writings, who there interpret\n'
  'those words for the measured quantities. Nor do those less defile the\n'
  'purity of mathematical and philosophical truths, who confound real quan-\n'
  'tities themselves with their relations and vulgar measures.\n'
  '\n'
  'It is indeed a matter of great difficulty to discover, and effectually to\n'
  'distinguish, the true motions of particular bodies from the apparent; be-\n'
  'cause the parts of that immovable space, in which those motions are per-\n'
  'formed, do by no means come under the observation of our senses. Yet\n'
  'the thing is not altogether desperate; for we have some arguments to\n'
  'guide us, partly from the apparent motions, which are the differences of\n'
  'the true motions; partly from the forces, which are the causes and effects\n'
  'of the true motions. For instance, if two globes, kept at a given distance\n'
  'one from the other by means of a cord that connects them, were revolved\n'
  'about their common centre of gravity, we might, from the tension of the\n'
  'cord, discover the endeavour of the globes to recede from the axis of '
  'their\n'
  'motion, and from thence we might compute the quantity of their circular\n'
  'motions. And then if any equal forces should be impressed at once on the\n'
  'alternate faces of the globes to augment or diminish their circular '
  'motions,\n'
  'from the increase or decr ase of the tension of the cord, we might infer\n'
  'the increment or decrement of their motions; and thence would be found\n'
  'on what faces those forces ought to be impressed, that the motions of the\n',

  'SINCE the ancients (as we are told by Pappus), made great account of\n'
  'the science of mechanics in the investigation of natural things; and the\n'
  'moderns, laying aside substantial forms and occult qualities, have endeav-\n'
  'oured to subject the phenomena of nature to the laws of mathematics, I\n'
  'have in this treatise cultivated mathematics so far as it regards '
  'philosophy.\n'
  'The ancients considered mechanics in a twofold respect ; as rational, '
  'which\n'
  'proceeds accurately by demonstration ; and practical. To practical me-\n'
  'chanics all the manual arts belong, from which mechanics took its name.\n'
  'But as artificers do not work with perfect accuracy, it comes to pass that\n'
  'mechanics is so distinguished from geometry, that what is perfectly accu-\n'
  'rate is called geometrical ; what is less so, is called mechanical. But '
  'the\n'
  'errors are not in the art, but in the artif.cers. He that works with less\n'
  'accuracy is an imperfect mechanic; and if any could work with perfect\n'
  'accuracy, he would be the most perfect mechanic of all ; for the '
  'description\n'
  'of right lines and circles, upon which geometry is founded, belongs to me-\n'
  'chanics. Geometry does not teach us to draw these lines, but requires\n'
  'them to be drawn ; for it requires that the learner should first be taught\n'
  'to describe these accurately, before he enters upon geometry ; then it '
  'shows\n'
  'how by these operations problems may be solved. To describe right lines\n'
  "and circles are problems, but not geometrical problems. 'The solution of\n"
  'these problems is required from mechanics; and by geometry the use of\n'
  'them, when so solved, is shown ; and it is the glory of geometry that from\n'
  'those few principles, brought from without, it is able to produce so many\n'
  'things. Therefore geometry is founded in mechanical practice, and is\n'
  'nothing but that part of universal mechanics which accurately proposes\n'
  'and demonstrates the art of measuring. But since the manual arts are\n'
  'chiefly conversant in the moving of bodies, it comes to pass that geometry\n'
  'is commonly referred to their magnitudes, and mechanics to their motion.\n'
  'In this sense rational mechanics will be the science of motions resulting\n'
  'from any forces whatsoever, and of the forces required to produce any mo-\n'
  'tions, accurately proposed and demonstrated. This part of mechanics was\n'

  'cultivated by the ancients in the five powers which relate to manual arts\n'
  'who considered gravity (it not being a manual power), no otherwise than\n'
  'as it moved weights by those powers. Our design not respecting arts, but\n'
  'philosophy, and our subject not manual but natural powers, we consider\n'
  'chiefly those things which relate to gravity, levity, elastic force, the '
  'resist-\n'
  'ance of fluids, and the like forces, whether attractive or impulsive; and\n'
  'therefore we offer this work as the mathematical principles : f philosophy '
  '; for\n'
  'all the difficulty of philosophy seems to consist in this -- from the '
  'phænom-\n'
  'ena of motions to investigate the forces of nature, and then from these\n'
  'forces to demonstrate the other phenomena; and to this end the general\n'
  'propositions in the first and second book are directed. In the third book\n'
  'we give an example of this in the explication of the System of the World ;\n'
  'for by the propositions mathematically demonstrated in the former books,\n'
  'we in the third derive from the celestial phenomena the forces of gravity\n'
  'with which bodies tend to the sun and the several planets. Then from these\n'
  'forces, by other propositions which are also mathematical, we deduce the '
  'mo-\n'
  'tions of the planets, the comets, the moon, and the sea. I wish we could '
  'de-\n'
  'rive the rest of the phenomena of nature by the same kind of reasoning '
  'from\n'
  'mechanical principles ; for I am induced by many reasons to suspect that\n'
  'they may all depend upon certain forces by which the particles of bodies,\n'
  'by some causes hitherto unknown, are either mutually impelled towards\n'
  'each other, and cohere in regular figures, or are repelled and recede from\n'
  'each other; which forces being unknown, philosophers have hitherto at-\n'
  'tempted the search of nature in vain; but I hope the principles here laid\n'
  'down will afford some light either to this or some truer method of '
  'philosophy.\n'
  '\n'
  'In the publication of this work the most acute and universally learned\n'
  'Mr. Edmund Halley not only assisted me with his pains in correcting the\n'
  'press and taking care of the schemes, but it was to his solicitations that '
  'its\n'
  'becoming public is owing ; for when he had obtained of me my demonstra-\n'
  'tions of the figure of the celestial orbits, he continually pressed me to '
  'com-\n'
  'municate the same to the Royal Society, who afterwards, by their kind en-\n'
  'couragement and entreaties, engaged me to think of publishing them. But\n'
  'after I had begun to consider the inequalities of the lunar motions, and\n'
  'had entered upon some other things relating to the laws and measures of\n'
  'gravity, and other forces ; and the figures that would be described by '
  'bodie?\n'
  'attracted according to given laws ; and the motion of several bodies '
  'moving\n'
  'among themselves ; the motion of bodies in resisting mediums; the forces,\n'
  'densities, and motions, of m‹ liums ; the orbits of the comets, and such '
  'like ;\n'

  'deferred that publication till I had made a search into those matters, and\n'
  'could put forth the whole together. What relates to the lunar motions (be-\n'
  'ing imperfect), I have put all together in the corollaries of Prop. 66, to\n'
  'avoid being obliged to propose and distinctly demonstrate the several '
  'things\n'
  'there contained in a method more prolix than the subject deserved, and in-\n'
  'terrupt the series of the several propositions. Some things, found out '
  'after\n'
  'the rest, I chose to insert in places less suitable, rather than change '
  'the\n'
  'number of the propositions and the citations. I heartily beg that what 1\n'
  'have here done may be read with candour; and that the defects in a\n'
  'subject so difficult be not so much reprehended as kindly supplied, and '
  'in-\n'
  'vestigated by new endeavours of my readers.\n'

  'In the second edition the second section of the first book was enlarged.\n'
  'In the seventh section of the second book the theory of the resistances of '
  'fluids\n'
  'was more accurately investigated, and confirmed by new experiments. In\n'
  "the third book the moon's theory and the præcession of the equinoxes were\n"
  'more fully deduced from their principles; and the theory of the comets\n'
  'was confirmed by more examples of the calculation of their orbits, done\n'
  'also with greater accuracy.\n'
  '\n'
  'In this third edition the resistance of mediums is somewhat more largely\n'
  'handled than before; and new experiments of the resistance of heavy\n'
  'bodies falling in air are added. In the third book, the argument to prove\n',
  '\n'

  '<!-- PageHeader="THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES" -->\n'
  '\n'
  'the air passes ; at another time it will be another part of the same, and '
  'so,\n'
  'absolutely understood, it will be perpetually mutable.\n'
  '\n'
  'III. Place is a part of space which a body takes up, and is according to\n'
  'the space, either absolute or relative. I say, a part of space; not the '
  'situation,\n'
  'nor the external surface of the body. For the places of equal solids are\n'
  'always equal; but their superfices, by reason of their dissimilar figures, '
  'are\n'
  'often unequal. Positions properly have no quantity, nor are they so much\n'
  'the places themselves, as the properties of places. The motion of the '
  'whole\n'
  'is the same thing with the sum of the motions of the parts; that is, the\n'
  'translation of the whole, out of its place, is the same thing with the sum\n'
  'of the translations of the parts out of their places; and therefore the '
  'place\n'
  'of the whole is the same thing with the sum of the places of the parts, '
  'and\n'
  'for that reason, it is internal, and in the whole body.\n'
  '\n'
  'IV. Absolute motion is the translation of a body from one absolute\n'
  'place into another; and relative motion, the translation from one relative\n'
  'place into another. Thus in a ship under sail, the relative place of a '
  'body\n'
  'is that part of the ship which the body possesses; or that part of its '
  'cavity\n'
  'which the body fills, and which therefore moves together with the ship:\n'
  'and relative rest is the continuance of the body in the same part of the\n'
  'ship, or of its cavity. But real, absolute rest, is the continuance of the\n'
  'body in the same part of that immovable space, in which the ship itself,\n'
  'its cavity, and all that it contains, is moved. Wherefore, if the earth is\n'
  'really at rest, the body, which relatively rests in the ship, will really '
  'and\n'
  'absolutely move with the same velocity which the ship has on the earth.\n'
  'But if the earth also moves, the true and absolute motion of the body will\n'
  'arise, partly from the true motion of the earth, in immovable space ; '
  'partly\n'
  'from the relative motion of the ship on the earth; and if the body moves\n'
  'also relatively in the ship; its true motion will arise, partly from the '
  'true\n'
  'motion of the earth, in immovable space, and partly from the relative mo-\n'
  'tions as well of the ship on the earth, as of the body in the ship ; and '
  'from\n'
  'these relative motions will arise the relative motion of the body on the\n'
  'earth. As if that part of the earth, where the ship is, was truly moved\n'
  'toward the east, with a velocity of 10010 parts; while the ship itself, '
  'with\n'
  'a fresh gale, and full sails, is carried towards the west, with a velocity '
  'ex-\n'
  'pressed by 10 of those parts ; but a sailor walks in the ship towards the\n'
  'east, with 1 part of the said velocity ; then the sailor will be moved '
  'truly\n'
  'in immovable space towards the east, with a velocity of 10001 parts, and\n'
  'relatively on the earth towards the west, with a velocity of 9 of those '
  'parts.\n'
  '\n'
  'Absolute time, in astronomy, is distinguished from relative, by the equa-\n'
  'tion or correction of the vulgar time. For the natural days are truly un-\n'
  'equal, though they are commonly considered as equal, and used for a meas-\n'
  'ure of time; astronomers correct this inequality for their more accurate\n'
  'deducing of the celestial motions. It may be, that there is no such thing\n'
  'as an equable motion, whereby time may be accurately measured. All mo\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageBreak -->\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageNumber="79" -->\n'
  '<!-- PageHeader="OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY." -->\n'
  '\n'
  'tions may be accelerated and retarded, but the true, or equable, progress '
  'of\n'
  'absolute time is liable to no change. The duration or perseverance of the\n'
  'existence of things remains the same, whether the motions are swift or '
  'slow,\n'
  'or none at all : and therefore it ought to be distinguished from what are\n'
  'only sensible measures thereof; and out of which we collect it, by means\n'
  'of the astronomical equation. The necessity of which equation, for deter-\n'
  'mining the times of a phenomenon, is evinced as well from the experiments\n'
  'of the pendulum clock, as by eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter.\n'
  '\n'
  'As the order of the parts of time is immutable, so also is the order of\n'
  'the parts of space. Suppose those parts to be moved out of their places, '
  'and\n'
  'they will be moved (if the expression may be allowed) out of themselves.\n'
  'For times and spaces are, as it were, the places as well of themselves as '
  'of\n'
  'all other things. All things are placed in time as to order of succession '
  ';\n'
  'and in space as to order of situation. It is from their essence or nature\n'
  'that they are places; and that the primary places of things should be\n'
  'moveable, is absurd. These are therefore the absolute places; and trans-\n'
  'lations out of those places, are the only absolute motions.\n'
  '\n'
  'But because the parts of space cannot be seen, or distinguished from one\n'
  'another by our senses, therefore in their stead we use sensible measures '
  'of\n'
  'them. For from the positions and distances of things from any body con-\n'
  'sidered as immovable, we define all places; and then with respect to such\n'
  'places, we estimate all motions, considering bodies as transferred from '
  'some\n'
  "of those places into others. And'so, instead of absolute places and "
  'motions,\n'
  'we use relative ones; and that without any inconvenience in common af-\n'
  'ťairs; but in philosophical disquisitions, we ought to abstract from our\n'
  'senses, and consider things themselves, distinct from what are only '
  'sensible\n'
  'measures of them. For it may be that there is no body really at rest, to\n'
  'which the places and motions of others may be referred.\n'
  '\n'
  'But we may distinguish rest and motion, absolute and relative, one from\n'
  'the other by their properties, causes and effects. It is a property of '
  'rest,\n'
  'that bodies really at rest do rest in respect to one another. And '
  'therefore\n'
  'as it is possible, that in the remote regions of the fixed stars, or '
  'perhaps\n'
  'far beyond them, there may be some body absolutely at rest; but impossi-\n'
  'ble to know, from the position of bodies to one another in our regions\n'
  'whether any of these do keep the same position to that remote body ; it\n'
  'follows that absolute rest cannot be determined from the position of '
  'bodies\n'
  'in our regions.\n'
  '\n'
  'It is a property of motion, that the parts, which retain given positions\n'
  'to their wholes, do partake of the motions of those wholes. For all the\n'
  'parts of revolving bodies endeavour to recede from the axis of motion ;\n'
  'and the impetus of bodies moving forward, arises from the joint impetus\n'
  'of all the parts. Therefore, if surrounding bodies are moved, those that\n'
  'are relatively at rest within them, will partake of their motion. Upon\n'
  'which account, the true and absolute motion of a body cannot be deter-\n'
  '\n'

  '\n'
  '<!-- PageNumber="80" -->\n'

  '\n'
  'mined by the translation of it from those which only seem to rest ; for '
  'the\n'
  'external bodies ought not only to appear at rest, but to be really at '
  'rest.\n'
  'For otherwise, all included bodies, beside their translation from near the\n'
  'surrounding ones, partake likewise of their true motions; and though that\n'
  'translation were not made they would not be really at rest, but only seem\n'
  'to be so. For the surrounding bodies stand in the like relation to the\n'
  'surrounded as the exterior part of a whole does to the interior, or as the\n'
  'shell does to the kernel; but, if the shell moves, the kernel will also\n'
  'move, as being part of the whole, without any removal from near the '
  'shell.\n'],
 ['the thick rushing, stupendous results overpowered him ; he be-\n'
  'came unable to carry on the process of calculation, and intrusted\n'
  'its completion to one of his friends. The discoverer had, indeed,\n'
  "grasped the master-fact. The law of falling bodies at the earth's\n"
  'surface was at length identified with that which guided the moon\n'
  'in her orbit. And so his GREAT THOUGHT, that had for sixteen\n'
  'years loomed up in dim, gigantic outline, amid the first dawn of a\n'
  'plausible hypothesis, now stood forth, radiant and not less grand,\n'
  'in the mid-day light of demonstrated truth.\n'
  '\n'
  'It were difficult, nay impossible to imagine, even, the influence\n'
  "of a result like this upon a mind like Newton's. It was as if the\n"
  'keystone had been fitted to the glorious arch by which his spirit\n'
  'should ascend to the outskirts of infinite space-spanning the immea-\n'
  'surable-weighing the imponderable-computing the incalculable\n'
  '-mapping out the marchings of the planets, and the far-wander-\n'
  'ings of the comets, and catching, bring back to earth some clearer\n'
  'notes of that higher melody which, as a sounding voice, bears\n'
  'perpetual witness to the design and omnipotence of a creating\n'
  'Deity.\n'
  '\n'
  'Newton, extending the law thus obtained, composed a series\n'
  'of about twelve propositions on the motion of the primary planets\n'

  'about the sun. These were sent to London, and communicated\n'
  'to the Royal Society about the end of 1683. At or near this pe-\n'
  'riod, other philosophers, as Sir Christopher Wren, Dr. Halley,\n'
  'and Dr. Hooke, were engaged in investigating the same subject ;\n'
  'but with no definite or satisfactory results. Dr. Halley, having\n'
  "seen, it is presumed, our author's propositions, went in August,\n"
  '1684, to Cambridge to consult with him upon the subject.\n'
  'Newton assured him that he had brought the demonstration to\n'
  'perfection. In November, Dr. Halley received a copy of the\n'
  'work ; and, in the following month, announced it to the Royal\n'
  "Society, with the author's promise to have it entered upon their\n"
  'Register. Newton, subsequently reminded by the Society of his\n'
  'promise, proceeded in the diligent preparation of the work, and,\n'
  'though suffering an interruption of six weeks, transmitted the\n'
  'manuscript of the first book to London before the end of April.\n'
  'The work was entitled PHILOSOPHIE NATURALIS PRINCIPIA\n'
  'MATHEMATICA, dedicated to the Royal Society, and presented\n'
  'thereto on the 28th of April, 1685-6. The highest encomiums\n'
  'were passed upon it ; and the council resolved, on the 19th of\n'
  'May, to print it at the expense of the Society, and under the di-\n'
  'rection of Dr. Halley. The latter, a few days afterward, com-\n'
  'municated these steps to Newton, who, in a reply, dated the 20th\n'
  'of June, holds the following language :- " The proof you sent me\n'
  'I like very well. I designed the whole to consist of three books ;\n'
  'the second was finished last summer, being short, and only wants\n'
  'transcribing, and drawing the cuts fairly. Some new propositions\n'
  'I have since thought on, which I can as well let alone. The\n'
  'third wants the theory of comets. In autumn last, I spent two\n'
  'months in calculation to no purpose for want of a good method.\n'
  'which made me afterward return to the first book, and enlarge it\n'
  'with diverse propositions, somé relating to comets, others to other\n'
  'things found out last winter. The third I now design to sup-\n'
  'press. Philosophy is such an impertinently litigious lady, that a\n'
  'man had as good be engaged in law-suits as have to do with her.\n'
  'I found it so formerly, and now I can no sooner come near her\n'
  'again, but she gives me warning. The first two books without\n'
  'the third will not so well bear the title of Philosophie Naturalis\n'

  'Principia Mathematicia ; and thereupon I had altered it to this,\n'
  'De Motu Corporum Libri duo. But after second thought I re-\n'
  'tain the former title. It will help the sale of the book, which I\n'
  'ought not to diminish now \'tis yours."\n'
  '\n'
  'This " warning" arose from some pretensions put forth by Dr.\n'
  'Hooke. And though Newton gave a minute and positive refuta-\n'
  'tions of such claims, yet, to reconcile all differences, he gener-\n'
  'ously added to Prop. IV. Cor. 6, Book I., a Scholium, in which\n'
  'Wren, Hooke and Halley are acknowledged to have indepen-\n'
  'dently deduced the law of gravity from the second law of\n'
  'Kepler.\n'
  '\n'
  'The suppression of the third book Dr. Halley could not endure\n'
  'to see. "I must again beg you" says he, "not to let your re-\n'
  'sentments run so high as to deprive us of your third book, where-\n'
  'in your applications of your mathematical doctrine to the theory\n'
  'of comets, and several curious experiments, which, as I guess by\n'
  'what you write ought to compose it, will undoubtedly render it\n'
  'acceptable to those who will call themselves philosophers without\n'
  'mathematics, which are much the greater number." To these\n'
  'solicitations Newton yielded. There were no "resentments," how-\n'
  'ever, as we conceive, in his "design to suppress." He sought\n'
  'peace ; for he loved and valued it above all applause. But, in\n'
  "spite of his efforts for tranquillity's sake, his course of discovery\n"
  'was all along molested by ignorance or presumptuous rivalry.\n'
  '\n'
  'The publication of the great work now went rapidly forwards.\n'
  'The second book was sent to the Society, and presented on the\n'
  '2d March ; the third, on the 6th April ; and the whole was com-\n'
  'pleted and published in the month of May, 1686-7. In the sec-\n'
  'ond Lemma of the second book, the fundamental principle of his\n'
  'fluxionary calculus was, for the first time, given to the world ; but\n'
  'its algorithm or notation did not appear till published in the\n'
  "second volume of Dr. Wallis's works, in 1693.\n"
  '\n'
  'And thus was ushered into existence The PRINCIPIA-a work\n'
  'to which pre-eminence above all the productions of the human\n'
  'intellect has been awarded-a work that must be esteemed of\n'
  'priceless worth so long as Science has a votary, or a single wor-\n'
  'shipper be left to kneel at the altar of Truth.\n'

  'The entire work bears the general title of THE MATHEMATICAL\n'
  'PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. It consists of three books:\n'
  'the first two, entitled, OF THE MOTION OF BODIES, are occupied\n'
  'with the laws and conditions of motions and forces, and are illus-\n'
  'trated with many scholia treating of some of the most general\n'
  'and best established points in philosophy, such as the density and\n'
  'resistance of bodies, spaces void of matter, and the motion of\n'
  'sound and light. From these principles, there is deduced, in the\n'
  'third book, drawn up in as popular a style as possible and entitled,\n',
  'OF THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD, the constitution of the system of\n'
  'the world. In regard to this book, the author says-" I had, indeed,\n'
  'composed the third Book in a popular method, that it might be read\n'
  'by many ; but afterwards, considering that such as had not suf-\n'
  'ficently entered into the principles could not easily discover the\n'
  'strength of the consequences, nor lay aside the prejudices to which\n'
  'they had been many years accustomed, therefore, to prevent dis-\n'
  'putes which might be raised upon such accounts, I chose to reduce\n'
  'the substance of this Book into the form of Propositions (in the\n'
  'mathematical way), which should be read by those only who had\n'
  'first made themselves masters of the principles established in the\n'
  'preceding Books : not that I would advise any one to the previous\n'
  'study of every Proposition of those Books."-" It is enough it\n'
  'one carefully reads the Definitions, the Laws of Motion, and the\n'
  'three first Sections of the first Book. He may then pass on to\n'
  'this Book, and consult such of the remaining Propositions of the\n'
  'first two Books, as the references in this, and his occasions shall re-\n'
  'quire." So that " The System of the World" is composed both\n'
  '" in a popular method," and in the form of mathematical Propo-\n'
  'sitions.\n'
  '\n'
  "The principle of Universal Gravi' ation, namely, that every\n"
  'particle of matter is attracted by, or gravitates to, every other\n'
  'particle of matter, with a force inversely proportional to the\n'
  'squares of their distances-is the discovery which characterizes\n'
  'The PRINCIPIA. This principle the author deduced from the mo-\n'
  'tion of the moon, and the three laws of Kepler-laws, which\n'
  'Newton, in turn, by his greater law, demonstrated to be true.\n'
  '\n'
  'From the first law of Kepler, namely, the proportionality of\n'

  'the areas to the times of their description, our author inferred\n'
  'that the force which retained the planet in its orbit was always\n'
  'directed to the sun; and from the second, namely, that every\n'
  'planet moves in an ellipse with the sun in one of its foci, he drew\n'
  'the more general inference that the force by which the planet\n'
  'moves round that focus varies inversely as the square of its dis-\n'
  'tance therefrom : and he demonstrated that a planet acted upon\n'
  'by such a force could not move in any other curve than a conic\n'
  'section ; showing when the moving body would describe a circu-\n'
  'lar, an elliptical, a parabolic, or hyperbolic orbit. He demon-\n'
  'strated, too, that this force, or attracting, gravitating power re-\n'
  'sided in every, the least particle ; but that, in spherical masses, it\n'
  'operated as if confined to their centres; so that, one sphere or\n'
  'body will act upon another sphere or body, with a force directly\n'
  'proportional to the quantity of matter, and inversely as the square\n'
  'of the distance between their centres; and that their velocities of\n'
  'mutual approach will be in the inverse ratio of their quantities of\n'
  'matter. Thus he grandly outlined the Universal Law. Verify-\n'
  'ing its truth by the motions of terrestrial bodies, then by those of\n'
  'the moon and other secondary orbs, he finally embraced, in one\n'
  'mighty generalization, the entire Solar System-all the move-\n'

  'teaches that-" this most beautiful system of the sun, planets and\n'

  'since the light of the fixed stars is of the same nature with the\n'
  'light of the sun, and from every system light passes into all other\n'

  'In all these reasonings I suppose the fluid to consist of matter of '

  'any where therein may propagate with the same motion of its own, at dis-\n'
  'tances from itself continually equal, similar and equal motions in the '
  'fluid\n'
  'in the same interval of time. The matter by its circular motion endeavours\n'
  'to recede from the axis of the vortex, and therefore presses all the '
  'matter\n'
  'that lies beyond. This pressure makes the attrition greater, and the\n'
  'separation of the parts more difficult ; and by consequence diminishes\n'
  'the fluidity of the matter. Again ; if the parts of the fluid are in any '
  'one\n'
  'place denser or larger than in the others, the fluidity will be less in '
  'that\n'
  '¿ lace, because there are fewer superficies where the parts can be '
  'separated\n'

  'from each other. In these cases I suppose the defect of the fluidity to be\n'
  'supplied by the smoothness or softness of the parts, or some other condi-\n'
  'tion ; otherwise the matter where it is less fluid will cohere more, and '
  'be\n'
  'more sluggish, and therefore will receive the motion more slowly, and pro-\n'
  'pagate it farther than agrees with the ratio above assigned. If the vessel\n'
  'be not spherical, the particles will move in lines not circular, but '
  'answer-\n'
  'ing to the figure of the vessel; and the periodic times will be nearly as '
  'the\n'
  'squares of the mean distances from the centre. In the parts between the\n'
  'centre and the circumference the motions will be slower where the spaces\n'
  'are wide, and swifter where narrow ; but yet the particles will not tend to '
  'the\n'
  'circumference at all the more for their greater swiftness ; for they then\n'
  'describe arcs of less curvity, and the conatus of receding from the centre '
  'is\n'
  'as much diminished by the diminution of this curvature as it is augment-\n'
  'ed by the increase of the velocity. As they go out of narrow into wide\n'
  'spaces, they recede a little farther from the centre, but in doing so are '
  're-\n'
  'tarded ; and when they come out of wide into narrow spaces, they are again\n'
  'accelerated ; and so each particle ís retarded and accelerated by turns '
  'for\n'
  'ever. These things will come to pass in a rigid vessel; for the state of\n'
  'vortices in an infinite fluid is known by Cor. 6 of this Proposition.\n'
  '\n'
  'I have endeavoured in this Proposition to investigate the properties of\n'
  'vortices, that I might find whether the celestial phenomena can be '
  'explain-\n'
  'ed by them ; for the phenomenon is this, that the periodic times of the\n'
  'planets revolving about Jupiter are in the sesquiplicate ratio of their '
  'dis-\n'
  "tances from Jupiter's centre ; and the same rule obtains also among the\n"
  'planets that revolve about the sun. And these rules obtain also with the\n'
  'greatest accuracy, as far as has been yet discovered by astronomical obser '
  '-\n'
  'tion. Therefore if those planets are carried round in vortices revolving\n'
  'about Jupiter and the sun, the vortices must revolve according to that\n'
  'law. But here we found the periodic times of the parts of the vortex to\n'
  'be in the duplicate ratio of the distances from the centre of motion; and\n'
  'this ratio cannot be diminished and reduced to the sesquiplicate, unless\n'
  'either the matter of the vortex be more fluid the farther it is from the '
  'cen-\n'
  'tre, or the resistance arising from the want of lubricity in the parts of '
  'the\n'
  'fluid should, as the velocity with which the parts of the fluid are '
  'separated\n'
  'goes on increasing, be augmented with it in a greater ratio than that in\n'
  'which the velocity increases. But neither of these suppositions seem rea-\n'
  'sonable. The more gross and less fluid parts will tend to the circumfer-\n'
  'ence, unless they are heavy towards the centre. And though, for the sake\n'
  'of demonstration, I proposed, at the beginning of this Section, an Hypoth-\n'
  'esis that the resistance is proportional to the velocity, nevertheless, it '
  'is in\n'
  'truth probable that the resistance is in a less ratio than that of the '
  'velo-\n'
  'city ; which granted, the periodic times of the parts of the vortex will '
  'be\n'
  'in a greater than the duplicate ratio of the distances from its centre. '
  'If,\n'
  'as some think, the vortices move more swiftly near the centre, then slower\n'

  'to a certain limit, then again swifter near the circumference, certainly\n'
  'neither the sesquiplicate, nor any other certain and determinate ratio, '

  '# PROPOSITION LIII. THEOREM XLI.\n'
  '\n'
  'Bodies carried about in a vortex, and returning in the same orb, are of\n'
  'the same density with the vortex, and are moved according to the\n'
  'same law with the parts of the vortex, as to velocity and direction of\n'
  'motion.\n'
  '\n'
  'For if any small part of the vortex, whose particles or physical points\n'
  'preserve a given situation among each other, be supposed to be congealed,\n'
  'this particle will move according to the same law as before, since no '
  'change\n'
  'is made either in its density, vis insita, or figure. And again ; if a '
  'congealed\n'
  'or solid part of the vortex be of the same density with the rest of the '
  'vortex,\n'
  'and be resolved into a fluid, this will move according to the same law as\n'
  'before, except in so far as its particles, now become fluid, may be moved\n'
  'among themselves. Neglect, therefore, the motion of the particles among\n'
  'themselves as not at all concerning the progressive motion of the whole, '
  'and\n'
  'the motion of the whole will be the same as before. But this motion will '
  'be\n'
  'the same with the motion of other parts of the vortex at equal distances\n'
  'from the centre; because the solid, now resolved into a fluid, is become\n'
  'perfectly like to the other parts of the vortex. Therefore a solid, if it '
  'be\n'
  'of the same density with the matter of the vortex, will move with the same\n'
  'motion as the parts thereof, being relatively at rest in the matter that '

  "## THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE\n"
  '\n'
  'SINCE the ancients (as we are told by Pappus), made great account of\n'
  'the science of mechanics in the investigation of natural things; and the\n'
  'moderns, laying aside substantial forms and occult qualities, have endeav-\n'
  'oured to subject the phenomena of nature to the laws of mathematics, I\n'
  'have in this treatise cultivated mathematics so far as it regards '
  'philosophy.\n'
  'The ancients considered mechanics in a twofold respect ; as rational, '
  'which\n'
  'proceeds accurately by demonstration ; and practical. To practical me-\n'
  'chanics all the manual arts belong, from which mechanics took its name.\n'
  'But as artificers do not work with perfect accuracy, it comes to pass that\n'
  'mechanics is so distinguished from geometry, that what is perfectly accu-\n'
  'rate is called geometrical ; what is less so, is called mechanical. But '
  'the\n'
  'errors are not in the art, but in the artif.cers. He that works with less\n'
  'accuracy is an imperfect mechanic; and if any could work with perfect\n'
  'accuracy, he would be the most perfect mechanic of all ; for the '
  'description\n'
  'of right lines and circles, upon which geometry is founded, belongs to me-\n'
  'chanics. Geometry does not teach us to draw these lines, but requires\n'
  'them to be drawn ; for it requires that the learner should first be taught\n'
  'to describe these accurately, before he enters upon geometry ; then it '
  'shows\n'
  'how by these operations problems may be solved. To describe right lines\n'
  "and circles are problems, but not geometrical problems. 'The solution of\n"
  'these problems is required from mechanics; and by geometry the use of\n'
  'them, when so solved, is shown ; and it is the glory of geometry that from\n'
  'those few principles, brought from without, it is able to produce so many\n'
  'things. Therefore geometry is founded in mechanical practice, and is\n'
  'nothing but that part of universal mechanics which accurately proposes\n'
  'and demonstrates the art of measuring. But since the manual arts are\n'
  'chiefly conversant in the moving of bodies, it comes to pass that geometry\n'
  'is commonly referred to their magnitudes, and mechanics to their motion.\n'
  'In this sense rational mechanics will be the science of motions resulting\n'
  'from any forces whatsoever, and of the forces required to produce any mo-\n'
  'tions, accurately proposed and demonstrated. This part of mechanics was\n'

  '\n'
  'cultivated by the ancients in the five powers which relate to manual arts\n'
  'who considered gravity (it not being a manual power), no otherwise than\n'
  'as it moved weights by those powers. Our design not respecting arts, but\n'
  'philosophy, and our subject not manual but natural powers, we consider\n'
  'chiefly those things which relate to gravity, levity, elastic force, the '
  'resist-\n'
  'ance of fluids, and the like forces, whether attractive or impulsive; and\n'
  'therefore we offer this work as the mathematical principles : f philosophy '
  '; for\n'
  'all the difficulty of philosophy seems to consist in this -- from the '
  'phænom-\n'
  'ena of motions to investigate the forces of nature, and then from these\n'
  'forces to demonstrate the other phenomena; and to this end the general\n'
  'propositions in the first and second book are directed. In the third book\n'
  'we give an example of this in the explication of the System of the World ;\n'
  'for by the propositions mathematically demonstrated in the former books,\n'
  'we in the third derive from the celestial phenomena the forces of gravity\n'
  'with which bodies tend to the sun and the several planets. Then from these\n'
  'forces, by other propositions which are also mathematical, we deduce the '
  'mo-\n'
  'tions of the planets, the comets, the moon, and the sea. I wish we could '
  'de-\n'
  'rive the rest of the phenomena of nature by the same kind of reasoning '
  'from\n'
  'mechanical principles ; for I am induced by many reasons to suspect that\n'
  'they may all depend upon certain forces by which the particles of bodies,\n'
  'by some causes hitherto unknown, are either mutually impelled towards\n'
  'each other, and cohere in regular figures, or are repelled and recede from\n'
  'each other; which forces being unknown, philosophers have hitherto at-\n'
  'tempted the search of nature in vain; but I hope the principles here laid\n'
  'down will afford some light either to this or some truer method of '
  'philosophy.\n'
  '\n'
  'In the publication of this work the most acute and universally learned\n'
  'Mr. Edmund Halley not only assisted me with his pains in correcting the\n'
  'press and taking care of the schemes, but it was to his solicitations that '
  'its\n'
  'becoming public is owing ; for when he had obtained of me my demonstra-\n'
  'tions of the figure of the celestial orbits, he continually pressed me to '
  'com-\n'
  'municate the same to the Royal Society, who afterwards, by their kind en-\n'
  'couragement and entreaties, engaged me to think of publishing them. But\n'
  'after I had begun to consider the inequalities of the lunar motions, and\n'
  'had entered upon some other things relating to the laws and measures of\n'
  'gravity, and other forces ; and the figures that would be described by '

  'avoid being obliged to propose and distinctly demonstrate the several '
  'things\n'
  'there contained in a method more prolix than the subject deserved, and in-\n'
  'terrupt the series of the several propositions. Some things, found out '
  'after\n'
  'the rest, I chose to insert in places less suitable, rather than change '
  'the\n'
  'number of the propositions and the citations. I heartily beg that what 1\n'

  'more dense next the pulses, will partake of their motion. And because the\n'
  'progressive motion of the pulses arises from the perpetual relaxation of '
  'the\n'
  'denser parts towards the antecedent rare intervals ; and since the pulses '
  'will\n'
  'relax themselves on each hand towards the quiescent parts of the medium\n'
  'KL, NO, with very near the same celerity ; therefore the pulses will '
  'dilate\n'
  'themselves on all sides into the unmoved parts KI., NO, with almost the\n'
  'same celerity with which they are propagated directly from the centre A;\n'
  'and therefore will fill up the whole space KLON. Q.E.D. And we find\n'
  'the same by experience also in sounds which are heard through a mountain\n'
  'interposed ; and, if they come into a chamber through the window, dilate\n'
  'themselves into all the parts of the room, and are heard in every corner ;\n'
  'and not as reflected from the opposite walls, but directly propagated from\n'
  'the window, as far as our sense can judge.\n'

  'that the parts of the medium that are near the centre A disturb and '

  'those which lie farther from it; and since the parts which are urged are\n'
  'fluid, and therefore recede every way towards those spaces where they are\n'
  'less pressed, they will by consequence recede towards all the parts of the\n'
  'quiescent medium; as well to the parts on each hand, as KL and NO,\n'

 ['OF THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD, the constitution of the system of\n'
  'the world. In regard to this book, the author says-" I had, indeed,\n'
  'composed the third Book in a popular method, that it might be read\n'
  'by many ; but afterwards, considering that such as had not suf-\n'
  'ficently entered into the principles could not easily discover the\n'
  'strength of the consequences, nor lay aside the prejudices to which\n'
  'they had been many years accustomed, therefore, to prevent dis-\n'
  'putes which might be raised upon such accounts, I chose to reduce\n'
  'the substance of this Book into the form of Propositions (in the\n'
  'mathematical way), which should be read by those only who had\n'
  'first made themselves masters of the principles established in the\n'
  'preceding Books : not that I would advise any one to the previous\n'
  'study of every Proposition of those Books."-" It is enough it\n'
  'one carefully reads the Definitions, the Laws of Motion, and the\n'
  'three first Sections of the first Book. He may then pass on to\n'
  'this Book, and consult such of the remaining Propositions of the\n'
  'first two Books, as the references in this, and his occasions shall re-\n'
  'quire." So that " The System of the World" is composed both\n'

  "The principle of Universal Gravi' ation, namely, that every\n"
  'particle of matter is attracted by, or gravitates to, every other\n'
  'particle of matter, with a force inversely proportional to the\n'
  'squares of their distances-is the discovery which characterizes\n'
  'The PRINCIPIA. This principle the author deduced from the mo-\n'
  'tion of the moon, and the three laws of Kepler-laws, which\n'
  'Newton, in turn, by his greater law, demonstrated to be true.\n'

  'the areas to the times of their description, our author inferred\n'
  'that the force which retained the planet in its orbit was always\n'
  'directed to the sun; and from the second, namely, that every\n'
  'planet moves in an ellipse with the sun in one of its foci, he drew\n'
  'the more general inference that the force by which the planet\n'
  'moves round that focus varies inversely as the square of its dis-\n'
  'tance therefrom : and he demonstrated that a planet acted upon\n'
  'by such a force could not move in any other curve than a conic\n'
  'section ; showing when the moving body would describe a circu-\n'
  'lar, an elliptical, a parabolic, or hyperbolic orbit. He demon-\n'
  'strated, too, that this force, or attracting, gravitating power re-\n'
  'sided in every, the least particle ; but that, in spherical masses, it\n'
  'operated as if confined to their centres; so that, one sphere or\n'
  'body will act upon another sphere or body, with a force directly\n'
  'proportional to the quantity of matter, and inversely as the square\n'
  'of the distance between their centres; and that their velocities of\n'
  'mutual approach will be in the inverse ratio of their quantities of\n'
  'matter. Thus he grandly outlined the Universal Law. Verify-\n'
  'ing its truth by the motions of terrestrial bodies, then by those of\n'
  'the moon and other secondary orbs, he finally embraced, in one\n'
  'mighty generalization, the entire Solar System-all the move-\n'
  'ments of all its bodies-planets, satellites and comets-explain-\n'
  'ing and harmonizing the many diverse and theretofore inexplica-\n'

  'Guided by the genius of Newton, we see sphere bound to\n'
  'sphere, body to body, particle to particle, atom to mass, the min-\n'
  'utest part to the stupendous whole-each to each, each to all,\n'
  'and all to each-in the mysterious bonds of a ceaseless, recipro-\n'

  'alike present in the globular dew-drop, or oblate-spheroidal earth ;\n'
  'in the falling shower, or vast heaving ocean tides; in the flying\n'
  'thistle-down, or fixed, ponderous rock ; in the swinging pendulum,\n'
  'or time-measuring sun ; in the varying and unequal moon, or\n'
  "earth's slowly retrograding poles ; in the uncertain meteor, or\n"

  "crowd heaven's fathomless deeps.\n"
  '\n'
  'And yet Newton, amid the loveliness and magnitude of Om-\n'
  'nipotence, lost not sight of the Almighty One. A secondary,\n'
  'however universal, was not taken for the First Cause. An im-\n'
  'pressed force, however diffused and powerful, assumed not the\n'
  'functions of the creating, giving Energy. Material beauties,\n'
  'splendours, and sublimities, however rich in glory, and endless in\n'
  'extent, concealed not the attributes of an intelligent Supreme.\n'
  'From the depths of his own soul, through reason and the WORD,\n'
  'he had risen, à priori, to God : from the heights of Omnipotence,\n'
  'through the design and law of the builded universe, he proved à\n'
  'posteriori, a Deity. " I had," says he, “ an eye upon such prin-\n'
  'ciples as might work, with considering men, for the belief of a\n'
  'Deity," in writing the PRINCIPIA ; at the conclusion whereof, he\n'
  'teaches that-" this most beautiful system of the sun, planets and\n'
  'comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an\n'
  'intelligent and powerful Being. And if the fixed stars are the\n'
  'centres of other like systems, these, being forme l by the like\n'
  'wise counsels, must be all subject to the dominion of One; especially\n'
  'since the light of the fixed stars is of the same nature with the\n'
  'light of the sun, and from every system light passes into all other\n'
  'systems : and lest the systems of the fixed stars should, by their\n'
  'gravity, fall on each other mutually, he hath placed those systems\n'
  'at immense distances one from another.\n'

  'the dominion of God, not over his own body, as those imagine\n'

  'the thick rushing, stupendous results overpowered him ; he be-\n'
  'came unable to carry on the process of calculation, and intrusted\n'
  'its completion to one of his friends. The discoverer had, indeed,\n'
  "grasped the master-fact. The law of falling bodies at the earth's\n"
  'surface was at length identified with that which guided the moon\n'
  'in her orbit. And so his GREAT THOUGHT, that had for sixteen\n'
  'years loomed up in dim, gigantic outline, amid the first dawn of a\n'
  'plausible hypothesis, now stood forth, radiant and not less grand,\n'
  'in the mid-day light of demonstrated truth.\n'
  '\n'
  'It were difficult, nay impossible to imagine, even, the influence\n'
  "of a result like this upon a mind like Newton's. It was as if the\n"
  'keystone had been fitted to the glorious arch by which his spirit\n'
  'should ascend to the outskirts of infinite space-spanning the immea-\n'
  'surable-weighing the imponderable-computing the incalculable\n'

  'about the sun. These were sent to London, and communicated\n'
  'to the Royal Society about the end of 1683. At or near this pe-\n'
  'riod, other philosophers, as Sir Christopher Wren, Dr. Halley,\n'
  'and Dr. Hooke, were engaged in investigating the same subject ;\n'
  'but with no definite or satisfactory results. Dr. Halley, having\n'
  "seen, it is presumed, our author's propositions, went in August,\n"
  '1684, to Cambridge to consult with him upon the subject.\n'
  'Newton assured him that he had brought the demonstration to\n'
  'perfection. In November, Dr. Halley received a copy of the\n'
  'work ; and, in the following month, announced it to the Royal\n'
  "Society, with the author's promise to have it entered upon their\n"
  'Register. Newton, subsequently reminded by the Society of his\n'
  'promise, proceeded in the diligent preparation of the work, and,\n'
  'though suffering an interruption of six weeks, transmitted the\n'
  'manuscript of the first book to London before the end of April.\n'
  'The work was entitled PHILOSOPHIE NATURALIS PRINCIPIA\n'
  'MATHEMATICA, dedicated to the Royal Society, and presented\n'
  'thereto on the 28th of April, 1685-6. The highest encomiums\n'
  'were passed upon it ; and the council resolved, on the 19th of\n'
  'May, to print it at the expense of the Society, and under the di-\n'
  'rection of Dr. Halley. The latter, a few days afterward, com-\n'
  'municated these steps to Newton, who, in a reply, dated the 20th\n'
  'of June, holds the following language :- " The proof you sent me\n'
  'I like very well. I designed the whole to consist of three books ;\n'
  'the second was finished last summer, being short, and only wants\n'
  'transcribing, and drawing the cuts fairly. Some new propositions\n'
  'I have since thought on, which I can as well let alone. The\n'
  'third wants the theory of comets. In autumn last, I spent two\n'
  'months in calculation to no purpose for want of a good method.\n'
  'which made me afterward return to the first book, and enlarge it\n'
  'with diverse propositions, somé relating to comets, others to other\n'
  'things found out last winter. The third I now design to sup-\n'
  'press. Philosophy is such an impertinently litigious lady, that a\n'
  'man had as good be engaged in law-suits as have to do with her.\n'
  'I found it so formerly, and now I can no sooner come near her\n'
  'again, but she gives me warning. The first two books without\n'
  'the third will not so well bear the title of Philosophie Naturalis\n'

  'Principia Mathematicia ; and thereupon I had altered it to this,\n'
  'De Motu Corporum Libri duo. But after second thought I re-\n'
  'tain the former title. It will help the sale of the book, which I\n'
  'ought not to diminish now \'tis yours."\n'
  '\n'
  'This " warning" arose from some pretensions put forth by Dr.\n'
  'Hooke. And though Newton gave a minute and positive refuta-\n'
  'tions of such claims, yet, to reconcile all differences, he gener-\n'
  'ously added to Prop. IV. Cor. 6, Book I., a Scholium, in which\n'
  'Wren, Hooke and Halley are acknowledged to have indepen-\n'
  'dently deduced the law of gravity from the second law of\n'
  'Kepler.\n'
  '\n'
  'The suppression of the third book Dr. Halley could not endure\n'
  'to see. "I must again beg you" says he, "not to let your re-\n'
  'sentments run so high as to deprive us of your third book, where-\n'
  'in your applications of your mathematical doctrine to the theory\n'
  'of comets, and several curious experiments, which, as I guess by\n'
  'what you write ought to compose it, will undoubtedly render it\n'
  'acceptable to those who will call themselves philosophers without\n'
  'mathematics, which are much the greater number." To these\n'
  'solicitations Newton yielded. There were no "resentments," how-\n'
  'ever, as we conceive, in his "design to suppress." He sought\n'
  'peace ; for he loved and valued it above all applause. But, in\n'
  "spite of his efforts for tranquillity's sake, his course of discovery\n"
  'was all along molested by ignorance or presumptuous rivalry.\n'
  '\n'
  'The publication of the great work now went rapidly forwards.\n'
  'The second book was sent to the Society, and presented on the\n'
  '2d March ; the third, on the 6th April ; and the whole was com-\n'
  'pleted and published in the month of May, 1686-7. In the sec-\n'
  'ond Lemma of the second book, the fundamental principle of his\n'
  'fluxionary calculus was, for the first time, given to the world ; but\n'
  'its algorithm or notation did not appear till published in the\n'
  "second volume of Dr. Wallis's works, in 1693.\n"
  '\n'
  'And thus was ushered into existence The PRINCIPIA-a work\n'
  'to which pre-eminence above all the productions of the human\n'
  'intellect has been awarded-a work that must be esteemed of\n'
  'priceless worth so long as Science has a votary, or a single wor-\n'

  "## THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE\n"
  '\n'
  'SINCE the ancients (as we are told by Pappus), made great account of\n'
  'the science of mechanics in the investigation of natural things; and the\n'
  'moderns, laying aside substantial forms and occult qualities, have endeav-\n'
  'oured to subject the phenomena of nature to the laws of mathematics, I\n'
  'have in this treatise cultivated mathematics so far as it regards '
  'philosophy.\n'
  'The ancients considered mechanics in a twofold respect ; as rational, '
  'which\n'
  'proceeds accurately by demonstration ; and practical. To practical me-\n'
  'chanics all the manual arts belong, from which mechanics took its name.\n'
  'But as artificers do not work with perfect accuracy, it comes to pass that\n'
  'mechanics is so distinguished from geometry, that what is perfectly accu-\n'
  'rate is called geometrical ; what is less so, is called mechanical. But '
  'the\n'
  'errors are not in the art, but in the artif.cers. He that works with less\n'
  'accuracy is an imperfect mechanic; and if any could work with perfect\n'
  'accuracy, he would be the most perfect mechanic of all ; for the '
  'description\n'
  'of right lines and circles, upon which geometry is founded, belongs to me-\n'
  'chanics. Geometry does not teach us to draw these lines, but requires\n'
  'them to be drawn ; for it requires that the learner should first be taught\n'
  'to describe these accurately, before he enters upon geometry ; then it '
  'shows\n'
  'how by these operations problems may be solved. To describe right lines\n'
  "and circles are problems, but not geometrical problems. 'The solution of\n"
  'these problems is required from mechanics; and by geometry the use of\n'
  'them, when so solved, is shown ; and it is the glory of geometry that from\n'
  'those few principles, brought from without, it is able to produce so many\n'
  'things. Therefore geometry is founded in mechanical practice, and is\n'
  'nothing but that part of universal mechanics which accurately proposes\n'
  'and demonstrates the art of measuring. But since the manual arts are\n'
  'chiefly conversant in the moving of bodies, it comes to pass that geometry\n'
  'is commonly referred to their magnitudes, and mechanics to their motion.\n'
  'In this sense rational mechanics will be the science of motions resulting\n'
  'from any forces whatsoever, and of the forces required to produce any mo-\n'
  'tions, accurately proposed and demonstrated. This part of mechanics was\n'

  '\n'
  'cultivated by the ancients in the five powers which relate to manual arts\n'
  'who considered gravity (it not being a manual power), no otherwise than\n'
  'as it moved weights by those powers. Our design not respecting arts, but\n'
  'philosophy, and our subject not manual but natural powers, we consider\n'
  'chiefly those things which relate to gravity, levity, elastic force, the '
  'resist-\n'
  'ance of fluids, and the like forces, whether attractive or impulsive; and\n'
  'therefore we offer this work as the mathematical principles : f philosophy '
  '; for\n'
  'all the difficulty of philosophy seems to consist in this -- from the '
  'phænom-\n'
  'ena of motions to investigate the forces of nature, and then from these\n'
  'forces to demonstrate the other phenomena; and to this end the general\n'
  'propositions in the first and second book are directed. In the third book\n'
  'we give an example of this in the explication of the System of the World ;\n'
  'for by the propositions mathematically demonstrated in the former books,\n'
  'we in the third derive from the celestial phenomena the forces of gravity\n'
  'with which bodies tend to the sun and the several planets. Then from these\n'
  'forces, by other propositions which are also mathematical, we deduce the '
  'mo-\n'
  'tions of the planets, the comets, the moon, and the sea. I wish we could '
  'de-\n'
  'rive the rest of the phenomena of nature by the same kind of reasoning '
  'from\n'
  'mechanical principles ; for I am induced by many reasons to suspect that\n'
  'they may all depend upon certain forces by which the particles of bodies,\n'
  'by some causes hitherto unknown, are either mutually impelled towards\n'
  'each other, and cohere in regular figures, or are repelled and recede from\n'
  'each other; which forces being unknown, philosophers have hitherto at-\n'
  'tempted the search of nature in vain; but I hope the principles here laid\n'
  'down will afford some light either to this or some truer method of '
  'philosophy.\n'
  '\n'
  'In the publication of this work the most acute and universally learned\n'
  'Mr. Edmund Halley not only assisted me with his pains in correcting the\n'
  'press and taking care of the schemes, but it was to his solicitations that '
  'its\n'
  'becoming public is owing ; for when he had obtained of me my demonstra-\n'
  'tions of the figure of the celestial orbits, he continually pressed me to '
  'com-\n'
  'municate the same to the Royal Society, who afterwards, by their kind en-\n'
  'couragement and entreaties, engaged me to think of publishing them. But\n'
  'after I had begun to consider the inequalities of the lunar motions, and\n'
  'had entered upon some other things relating to the laws and measures of\n'
  'gravity, and other forces ; and the figures that would be described by '
  'bodie?\n'
  'attracted according to given laws ; and the motion of several bodies '
  'moving\n'

  'deferred that publication till I had made a search into those matters, and\n'
  'could put forth the whole together. What relates to the lunar motions (be-\n'
  'ing imperfect), I have put all together in the corollaries of Prop. 66, to\n'
  'avoid being obliged to propose and distinctly demonstrate the several '
  'things\n'
  'there contained in a method more prolix than the subject deserved, and in-\n'
  'terrupt the series of the several propositions. Some things, found out '
  'after\n'
  'the rest, I chose to insert in places less suitable, rather than change '
  'the\n'
  'number of the propositions and the citations. I heartily beg that what 1\n'
  'have here done may be read with candour; and that the defects in a\n'
  'subject so difficult be not so much reprehended as kindly supplied, and '
  'in-\n'
  'vestigated by new endeavours of my readers.\n'

  'In the seventh section of the second book the theory of the resistances of '
  'fluids\n'
  'was more accurately investigated, and confirmed by new experiments. In\n'
  "the third book the moon's theory and the præcession of the equinoxes were\n"

  'quality of all bodies within the reach of our experiments ; and therefore\n'
  '(by Rule III) to be affirmed of all bodies whatsoever. If the @ther, or '
  'any\n'
  'other body, were either altogether void of gravity, or were to gravitate '
  'less\n'
  'in proportion to its quantity of matter, then, because (according to Aris-\n'

  'form, it might be changed at last into a body of the same condition with\n'
  'those which gravitate most in proportion to their quantity of matter ; '
  'and,\n'
  'on the other hand, the heaviest bodies, acquiring the first form of that\n'

  '## PROPOSITION VII. THEOREM VII.\n'
  '\n'
  'That there is a power of gravity tending to all bodies, proportional to\n'
  'the several quantities of matter which they contain.\n'
  '\n'
  'That all the planets mutually gravitate one towards another, we have\n'
  'proved before ; as well as that the force of gravity towards every one of '
  'them,\n'
  'considered apart, is reciprocally as the square of the distance of places '
  'from\n'
  'the centre of the planet. And thence (by Prop. LXIX, Book I, and its\n'
  'Corollaries) it follows, that the gravity tending towards all the planets '
  'is\n'
  'proportional to the matter which they contain.\n'
  '\n'
  'Moreover, since all the parts of any planet A gravitate towards any\n'
  'other planet B; and the gravity of every part is to the gravity of the\n'
  'whole as the matter of the part to the matter of the whole ; and (by Law\n'
  'III) to every action corresponds an equal re-action ; therefore the planet '
  'B\n'
  'will, on the other hand, gravitate towards all the parts of the planet A;\n'
  'and its gravity towards any one part will be to the gravity towards the\n'
  'whole as the matter of the part to the matter of the whole. Q.E.D.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 1. Therefore the force of gravity towards any whole planet arises\n'
  'from, and is compounded of, the forces of gravity towards all its parts.\n'
  'Magnetic and electric attractions afford us examples of this; for all at-\n'
  'traction towards the whole arises from the attractions towards the several\n'
  'parts. The thing may be easily understood in gravity, if we consider a\n'
  'greater planet, as formed of a number of lesser planets, meeting together '
  'in\n'
  'one globe ; for hence it would appear that the force of the whole must\n'
  'arise from the forces of the component parts. If it is objected, that, ac-\n'
  'cording to this law, all bodies with us must mutually gravitate one to-\n'
  'wards another, whereas no such gravitation any where appears, I answer,\n'
  'that since the gravitation towards these bodies is to the gravitation '
  'towards\n'
  'the whole earth as these bodies are to the whole earth, the gravitation '
  'to-\n'
  'wards them must be far less than to fall under the observation of our '
  'senses.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 2. The force of gravity towards the several equal particles of any\n'
  'body is reciprocally as the square of the distance of places from the '
  'parti-\n'
  'cles ; as appears from Cor. 3, Prop. LX.XIV, Book I.\n'

  '\n'
  'In two spheres mutually gravitating each towards the other, if the matter\n'
  'in places on all sides round about and equi-distant from the centres is\n'
  'similar, the weight of either sphere towards the other will be recipro-\n'
  'cally as the square of the distance between their centres.\n'
  '\n'
  'After I had found that the force of gravity towards a whole planet did\n'
  'arise from and was compounded of the forces of gravity towards all its\n'
  'parts, and towards every one part was in the reciprocal proportion of the\n'
  'squares of the distances from the part, I was yet in doubt whether that '
  're-\n'
  'ciprocal duplicate proportion did accurately hold, or but nearly so, in '
  'the\n'
  'total force compounded of so many partial ones; for it might be that the\n'
  'proportion which accurately enough took place in greater distances should\n'
  'be wide of the truth near the surface of the planet, where the distances '
  'of\n'
  'the particles are unequal, and their situation dissimilar. But by the help\n'
  'of Prop. LXXV and LXXVI, Book I, and their Corollaries, I was at last\n'
  'satisfied of the truth of the Proposition, as it now lies before us.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 1. Hence we may find and compare together the weights of bodies\n'
  'towards different planets ; for the weights of bodies revolving in circles\n'
  'about planets are (by Cor. 2, Prop. IV, Book I) as the diameters of the\n'
  'circles directly, and the squares of their periodic times reciprocally ; '
  'and\n'
  'their weights at the surfaces of the planets, or at any other distances '

  '\n'
  'The common centre of gravity of two or more bodies does not alter its\n'
  'state of motion or rest by the actions of the bodies among themselves ;\n'
  'and therefore the common centre of gravity of all bodies acting upon\n'
  'each other (excluding outward actions and impediments) is either at\n'
  'rest, or moves uniformly in a right line.\n'
  '\n'
  'For if two points proceed with an uniform motion in right lines, and\n'
  'their distance be divided in a given ratio, the dividing point will be '
  'either\n'
  'at rest, or proceed uniformly in a right line. This is demonstrated here-\n'
  'after in Lem. XXIII and its Corol., when the points are moved in the same\n'
  'plane; and by a like way of arguing, it may be demonstrated when the\n'
  'points are not moved in the same plane. Therefore if any number of\n'
  '1\\. dies move uniformly in right lines, the common centre of gravity of '
  'any\n'
  'two of them is either at rest, or proceeds uniformly in a right line; '
  'because\n'
  'the line which connects the centres of those two bodies so moving is '
  'divided at\n'
  'that common centre in a given ratio. In like manner the common centre\n'
  'of those two and that of a third body will be either at rest or moving '
  'uni-\n'
  'formly in a right line because at that centre the distance between the\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageBreak -->\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageNumber="SS" -->\n'
  '<!-- PageHeader="THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES" -->\n'
  '\n'
  'common centre of the two bodies, and the centre of this last, is divided '
  'in\n'
  'a given ratio. In like manner the common centre of these three, and of a\n'
  'fourth body, is either at rest, or moves uniformly in a right line; '
  'because\n'
  'the distance between the common centre of the three bodies, and the centre\n'
  'of the fourth is there also divided in a given ratio, and so on in '
  'infinitum.\n'
  'Therefore, in a system of bodies where there is neither any mutual action\n'
  'among themselves, nor any foreign force impressed upon them from without,\n'
  'and which consequently move uniformly in right lines, the common centre of\n'
  'gravity of them all is either at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right '
  'line.\n'
  '\n'
  'Moreover, in a system of two bodies mutually acting upon each other,\n'
  'since the distances between their centres and the common centre of gravity\n'
  'of both are reciprocally as the bodies, the relative motions of those '
  'bodies,\n'
  'whether of approaching to or of receding from that centre, will be equal\n'
  'among themselves. Therefore since the changes which happen to motions\n'
  'are equal and directed to contrary parts, the common centre of those '
  'bodies,\n'
  'by their mutual action between themselves, is neither promoted nor re-\n'
  'tarded, nor suffers any change as to its state of motion or rest. But in a\n'
  'system of several bodies, because the common centre of gravity of any two\n'
  'acting mutually upon each other suffers no change in its state by that ac-\n'
  'tion ; and much less the common centre of gravity of the others with which\n'
  'that action does not intervene: but the distance between those two centres\n'
  'is divided by the common centre of gravity of all the bodies into parts '
  're-\n'
  'ciprocally proportional to the total sums of those bodies whose centres '
  'they\n'
  'are; and therefore while those two centres retain their state of motion or\n'
  'rest, the common centre of all does also retain its state : it is manifest '
  'that\n'
  'the common centre of all never suffers any change in the state of its mo-\n'
  'tion or rest from the actions of any two bodies between themselves. But\n'
  'in such a system all the actions of the bodies among themselves either '
  'hap-\n'
  'pen between two bodies, or are composed of actions interchanged between\n'
  'some two bodies; and therefore they do never produce any alteration in\n'
  'the common centre of all as to its state of motion or rest. Wherefore\n'
  'since that centre, when the bodies do not act mutually one upon another,\n'
  'wither is at rest or moves uniformly forward in some right line, it will,\n'
  'Notwithstanding the mutual actions of the bodies among themselves, always\n'
  'pievere in its state, either of rest, or of proceeding uniformly in a '
  'right\n'
  'lin, unless it is forced out of this state by the action of some power im-\n'
  'pressed from without upon the whole system. And therefore the same law\n'
  'takes place in a system consisting of many bodies as in one single body,\n'
  'with vegard to their persevering in their state of motion or of rest. For\n'

  'Hitherto I have laid down such principles as have been received by math-\n'

  'scent of bodies observed the duplicate ratio of the time, and that the mo-\n'
  'tion of projectiles was in the curve of a parabola; experience agreeing\n'
  'with both, unless so far as these motions are a little retarded by the re-\n'
  'sistance of the air. When a body is falling, the uniform force of its\n'
  'gravity acting equally, impresses, in equal particles of time, equal '
  'forces\n'
  'upon that body, and therefore generates equal velocities ; and in the '
  'whole\n'
  'time impresses a whole force, and generates a whole velocity proportional\n'
  'to the time. And the spaces described in proportional times are as the\n'
  'velocities and the times conjunctly ; that is, in a duplicate ratio of the\n'

  'particle of matter, with a force inversely proportional to the\n'

  'The PRINCIPIA. This principle the author deduced from the mo-\n'

  'the areas to the times of their description, our author inferred\n'
  'that the force which retained the planet in its orbit was always\n'
  'directed to the sun; and from the second, namely, that every\n'
  'planet moves in an ellipse with the sun in one of its foci, he drew\n'
  'the more general inference that the force by which the planet\n'
  'moves round that focus varies inversely as the square of its dis-\n'
  'tance therefrom : and he demonstrated that a planet acted upon\n'
  'by such a force could not move in any other curve than a conic\n'
  'section ; showing when the moving body would describe a circu-\n'
  'lar, an elliptical, a parabolic, or hyperbolic orbit. He demon-\n'
  'strated, too, that this force, or attracting, gravitating power re-\n'
  'sided in every, the least particle ; but that, in spherical masses, it\n'
  'operated as if confined to their centres; so that, one sphere or\n'
  'body will act upon another sphere or body, with a force directly\n'
  'proportional to the quantity of matter, and inversely as the square\n'
  'of the distance between their centres; and that their velocities of\n'
  'mutual approach will be in the inverse ratio of their quantities of\n'
  'matter. Thus he grandly outlined the Universal Law. Verify-\n'
  'ing its truth by the motions of terrestrial bodies, then by those of\n'
  'the moon and other secondary orbs, he finally embraced, in one\n'

  '## AXIOMS, OR LAWS OF MOTION.\n'
  '\n'
  '\n'
  '### LAW I.\n'
  '\n'
  'Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a '
  'right\n'
  'line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed\n'
  'thereon.\n'
  '\n'
  'PROJECTILES persevere in their motions, so far as they are not retarded\n'
  'by the resistance of the air, or impelled downwards by the force of '
  'gravity\n'
  'A top, whose parts by their cohesion are perpetually drawn aside from\n'
  'rectilinear motions, does not cease its rotation, otherwise than as it is '
  're-\n'
  'tarded by the air. The greater bodies of the planets and comets, meeting\n'
  'with less resistance in more free spaces, preserve their motions both pro-\n'
  'gressive and circular for a much longer time.\n'
  '\n'
  '\n'
  '### LAW II.\n'
  '\n'
  'The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impress-\n'
  'ed ; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force\n'
  'is impressed.\n'
  '\n'
  'If any force generates a motion, a double force will generate double the\n'
  'motion, a triple force triple the motion, whether that force be impressed\n'
  'altogether and at once, or gradually and successively. And this motion\n'
  '(being always directed the same way with the generating force), if the '
  'body\n'
  'moved before, is added to or subducted from the former motion, according\n'
  'as they directly conspire with or are directly contrary to each other; or\n'
  'obliquely joined, when they are oblique, so as to produce a new motion\n'
  'compounded from the determination of both.\n'
  '\n'
  '\n'
  '### LAW III.\n'
  '\n'
  'To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction : or the mu-\n'
  'tual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and di-\n'
  'rected to contrary parts.\n'
  '\n'
  'Whatever draws or presses another is as much drawn or pressed by that\n'
  'other. If you press a stone with your finger, the finger is also pressed '
  'by\n'
  'the stone. If a horse draws a stone tied to a rope, the horse (if I may so\n'
  'say) will be equally drawn back towards the stone : for the distended '
  'rope,\n'
  'by the same endeavour to relax or unbend itself, will draw the horse as\n'
  'much towards the stone, as it does the stone towards the horse, and will\n'
  'obstruct the progress of the one as much as it advances that of the other.\n'

  'other, that body also (because of the equality of the mutual pressure) '
  'will\n'
  'undergo an equal change, in its own motion, towards the contrary part.\n'
  'The changes made by these actions are equal, not in the velocities but in\n'
  'the motions of bodies; that is to say, if the bodies are not hindered by '
  'any\n'
  'other impediments. For, because the motions are equally changed, the\n'
  'changes of the velocities made towards contrary parts are reciprocally '

  'Towards the close of a pleasant day in the early autumn of\n'

  'a century previous, the science of Astronomy had advanced with\n'

  'system, to investigate the phenomena, and to establish the laws\n'
  'of the heavenly bodies. Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Kepler,\n'
  'Galileo, and others had prepared and lighted the way for him\n'

  'its true lustre. At his bidding isolated facts were to take order\n'

  'this ablest man had come-was here. His mind, familiar with\n'
  'the knowledge of past effort, and its unequalled faculties develop-\n'
  'ed in transcendant strength, was now moving on to the very\n'
  'threshold of its grandest achievement. Step by step the untrod-\n'

  'The nature of gravity-that mysterious power which causes\n'

  'retaining that luminary in her orbit round the earth. But, though\n'
  'this power suffers no sensible variation, in the little change of\n'
  "distance from the earth's centre, at which we may place our-\n"

  'more or less diminution ? The conjecture appeared most proba-\n'
  'ble : and, in order to estimate what the degree of diminution\n'
  'might be, he considered that if the moon be retained in her orbit\n'
  'by the force of gravity, the primary planets must also be carried\n'
  'round the sun by the like power ; and, by comparing the periods\n'
  'of the several planets with their distances from the sun, he found\n'
  'that, if they were held in their courses by any power like gravity,\n'
  'its strength must decrease in the duplicate proportion of the in-\n'
  'crease of distance. In forming this conclusion, he supposed the\n'
  'planets to move in perfect circles, concentric to the sun. Now\n'
  "was this the law of the moon's motion ? Was such a force, em-\n"
  'anating from the earth and directed to the moon, sufficient, when\n'
  'diminished as the square of the distance, to retain her in her\n'
  'orbit ? To ascertain this master-fact, he compared the space\n'
  'through which heavy bodies fall, in a second of time, at a given\n'
  'distance from the centre of the earth, namely, at its surface, with\n'
  'the space through which the moon falls, as it were, to the earth,\n'
  'in the same time, while revolving in a circular orbit. He was\n'
  'absent from books; and, therefore, adopted, in computing the\n'
  "earth's diameter, the common estimate of sixty miles to a degree\n"
  'of latitude as then in use among geographers and navigators.\n'
  'The result of his calculations did not, of course, answer his ex-\n'
  'pectations ; hence, he concluded that some other cause, beyond the\n'
  'reach of observation-analogous, perhaps, to the vortices of Des-\n'
  'cartes-joined its action to that of the power of gravity upon the\n'
  'moon. Though by no means satisfied, he yet abandoned awhile\n'
  'further inquiry, and remained totally silent upon the subject.\n'
  '\n'
  'These rapid marches in the career of discovery, combined with\n'
  'the youth of Newton, seem to evince a penetration the most\n'
  'lively, and an invention the most exuberant. But in him there\n'
  'was a conjunction of influences as extraordinary as fortunate.\n'
  'Study, unbroker, persevering and profound carried on its inform-\n'
  'ing and disciplming work upon a genius, natively the greatest,\n'
  'and rendered freest in its movements, and clearest in its vision,\n'
  'through the untrammelling and enligt tening power of religion.\n'

  'those amazing abilities, which, grasping, with equal facility, the\n'

  'minute and the stupendous, brought these successively to light,\n'
  'and caused science to make them her own.\n'
  '\n'
  'In 1667, Newton was made a Junior Fellow ; and, in the year\n'
  'following, he took his degree of Master of Arts, and was appoint-\n'
  'ed to a Senior Fellowship.\n'
  '\n'
  'On his return to Cambridge, in 1668, he resumed his optical\n'
  'labours. Having thought of a delicate method of polishing metal,\n'
  'he proceeded to the construction of his newly projected reflect.\n'
  'ing telescope ; a small specimen of which he actually made with\n'
  'his own hands. It was six inches long ; and magnified about\n'
  'forty times ;- a power greater than a refracting instrument of six\n'
  'feet tube could exert with distinctness. Jupiter, with his four\n'
  'satellites, and the horns, or moon-like phases of Venus were\n'
  'plainly visible through it. THIS WAS THE FIRST REFLECTING\n'
  'TELESCOPE EVER EXECUTED AND DIRECTED TO THE HEAVENS.\n'
  'He gave an account of it, in a letter to a friend, dated February 23d,\n'
  '1668-9-a letter which is also remarkable for containing the first\n'
  'allusion to his discoveries " concerning the nature of light." En-\n'
  'couraged by the success of his first experiment, he again executed\n'
  'with his own hands, not long afterward, a second and superior\n'
  'instrument of the same kind. The existence of this having come\n'
  'to the knowledge of the Royal Society of London, in 1671, they\n'
  'requested it of Newton for examination. He accordingly sent it\n'
  'to them. It excited great admiration ; it was shown to the king ·\n'
  'a drawing and description of it was sent to Paris; and the tele-\n'
  'scope itself was carefully preserved in the Library of the Society.\n'
  'Newton lived to see his invention in public use, and of eminent\n'
  'service in the cause of science.\n'
  '\n'
  'In the spring of 1669, he wrote to his friend Francis Aston,\n'
  'Esq., then about setting out on his travels, a letter of advice and\n'
  'directions, it was dated May 18th, and is interesting as exhibit-\n'],
 ['OF THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD, the constitution of the system of\n'
  'the world. In regard to this book, the author says-" I had, indeed,\n'
  'composed the third Book in a popular method, that it might be read\n'
  'by many ; but afterwards, considering that such as had not suf-\n'
  'ficently entered into the principles could not easily discover the\n'
  'strength of the consequences, nor lay aside the prejudices to which\n'
  'they had been many years accustomed, therefore, to prevent dis-\n'
  'putes which might be raised upon such accounts, I chose to reduce\n'
  'the substance of this Book into the form of Propositions (in the\n'
  'mathematical way), which should be read by those only who had\n'
  'first made themselves masters of the principles established in the\n'
  'preceding Books : not that I would advise any one to the previous\n'
  'study of every Proposition of those Books."-" It is enough it\n'
  'one carefully reads the Definitions, the Laws of Motion, and the\n'
  'three first Sections of the first Book. He may then pass on to\n'
  'this Book, and consult such of the remaining Propositions of the\n'

  "The principle of Universal Gravi' ation, namely, that every\n"
  'particle of matter is attracted by, or gravitates to, every other\n'
  'particle of matter, with a force inversely proportional to the\n'
  'squares of their distances-is the discovery which characterizes\n'
  'The PRINCIPIA. This principle the author deduced from the mo-\n'
  'tion of the moon, and the three laws of Kepler-laws, which\n'
  'Newton, in turn, by his greater law, demonstrated to be true.\n'

  'the areas to the times of their description, our author inferred\n'
  'that the force which retained the planet in its orbit was always\n'
  'directed to the sun; and from the second, namely, that every\n'
  'planet moves in an ellipse with the sun in one of its foci, he drew\n'
  'the more general inference that the force by which the planet\n'
  'moves round that focus varies inversely as the square of its dis-\n'
  'tance therefrom : and he demonstrated that a planet acted upon\n'
  'by such a force could not move in any other curve than a conic\n'
  'section ; showing when the moving body would describe a circu-\n'
  'lar, an elliptical, a parabolic, or hyperbolic orbit. He demon-\n'
  'strated, too, that this force, or attracting, gravitating power re-\n'
  'sided in every, the least particle ; but that, in spherical masses, it\n'
  'operated as if confined to their centres; so that, one sphere or\n'
  'body will act upon another sphere or body, with a force directly\n'
  'proportional to the quantity of matter, and inversely as the square\n'
  'of the distance between their centres; and that their velocities of\n'
  'mutual approach will be in the inverse ratio of their quantities of\n'
  'matter. Thus he grandly outlined the Universal Law. Verify-\n'
  'ing its truth by the motions of terrestrial bodies, then by those of\n'
  'the moon and other secondary orbs, he finally embraced, in one\n'
  'mighty generalization, the entire Solar System-all the move-\n'
  'ments of all its bodies-planets, satellites and comets-explain-\n'
  'ing and harmonizing the many diverse and theretofore inexplica-\n'

  '\n'
  'And yet Newton, amid the loveliness and magnitude of Om-\n'

  'however universal, was not taken for the First Cause. An im-\n'
  'pressed force, however diffused and powerful, assumed not the\n'
  'functions of the creating, giving Energy. Material beauties,\n'
  'splendours, and sublimities, however rich in glory, and endless in\n'
  'extent, concealed not the attributes of an intelligent Supreme.\n'
  'From the depths of his own soul, through reason and the WORD,\n'
  'he had risen, à priori, to God : from the heights of Omnipotence,\n'
  'through the design and law of the builded universe, he proved à\n'
  'posteriori, a Deity. " I had," says he, “ an eye upon such prin-\n'
  'ciples as might work, with considering men, for the belief of a\n'
  'Deity," in writing the PRINCIPIA ; at the conclusion whereof, he\n'
  'teaches that-" this most beautiful system of the sun, planets and\n'
  'comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an\n'
  'intelligent and powerful Being. And if the fixed stars are the\n'
  'centres of other like systems, these, being forme l by the like\n'
  'wise counsels, must be all subject to the dominion of One; especially\n'
  'since the light of the fixed stars is of the same nature with the\n'
  'light of the sun, and from every system light passes into all other\n'
  'systems : and lest the systems of the fixed stars should, by their\n'
  'gravity, fall on each other mutually, he hath placed those systems\n'

  'Eternal, your Eternal, the Eternal of Israel, the Eternal of Gods ;\n',
  'of our experiments, are to be esteemed the universal qualities of all\n'
  'bodies whatsoever.\n'
  '\n'
  'For since the qualities of bodies are only known to us by experiments, we\n'
  'are to hold for universal all such as universally agree with experiments;\n'
  'and such as are not liable to diminution can never be quite taken away.\n'
  'We are certainly not to relinquish the evidence of experiments for the '

  'itself. We no other way know the extension of bodies than by our senses,\n'
  'nor do these reach it in all bodies; but because we perceive extension in\n'
  'all that are sensible, therefore we ascribe it universally to all others '
  'also.\n'
  'That abundance of bodies are hard, we learn by experience ; and because\n'
  'the hardness of the whole arises from the hardness of the parts, we '
  'therefore\n'
  'justly infer the hardness of the undivided particles not only of the '

  'we feel but of all others. That all bodies are impenetrable, we gather not\n'
  'from reason, but from sensation. The bodies which we handle we find im-\n'
  'penetrable, and thence conclude impenetrability to be an universal '
  'property\n'
  'of all bodies whatsoever. That all bodies are moveable, and endowed with\n'
  'certain powers (which we call the vires inertic) of persevering in their '
  'mo-\n'
  'tion, or in their rest, we only infer from the like properties observed in '

  'bodies which we have seen. The extension, hardness, impenetrability, mo-\n'
  'bility, and vis inertiæ of the whole, result from the extension, hardness,\n'
  'impenetrability, mobility, and vires inertic of the parts; and thence we\n'
  'conclude the least particles of all bodies to be also all extended, and '
  'hard\n'
  'and impenetrable, and moveable, and endowed with their proper vires inertia '
  '.\n'
  'And this is the foundation of all philosophy. Moreover, that the divided\n'
  'but contiguous particles of bodies may be separated from one another, is\n'
  'matter of observation; and, in the particles that remain undivided, our\n'
  'minds are able to distinguish yet lesser parts, as is mathematically '
  'demon-\n'
  'strated. But whether the parts so distinguished, and not yet divided, may,\n'
  'by the powers of Nature, be actually divided and separated from one an-\n'
  'other, we cannot certainly determine. Yet, had we the proof of but one\n'
  'experiment that any undivided particle, in breaking a hard and solid body,\n'
  'suffered a division, we might by virtue of this rule conclude that the un-\n'
  'divided as well as the divided particles may be divided and actually sep-\n'
  'arated to infinity.\n'
  '\n'
  'Lastly, if it universally appears, by experiments and astronomical obser-\n'
  'vations, that all bodies about the earth gravitate towards the earth, and\n'
  'that in proportion to the quantity of matter which they severally contain '
  ';\n'
  'that the moon likewise, according to the quantity of its matter, '
  'gravitates\n'
  'towards the earth; that, on the other hand, our sea gravitates towards the\n'
  'moon ; and all the planets mutually one towards another; and the comets\n'
  'in like manner towards the sun ; we must, in consequence of this rule, '
  'uni-\n'
  'versally allow that all bodies whatsoever are endowed with a principle of\n'
  'mutual gravitation. For the argument from the appearances concludes with\n'
  'more force for the universal gravitation of all bodies than for their impen '
  '.\n'
  'etrability; of which, among those in the celestial regions, we have no ex-\n'
  'periments, nor any manner of observation. Not that I affirm gravity to be\n'
  'essential to bodies : by their vis insita I mean nothing but their vis '
  'incrtice,\n'
  'This is immutable. Their gravity is diminished as they recede from the\n'

  'Mr. Pound has determined, by the help of excellent micrometers, the\n'
  'diameters of Jupiter and the elongation of its satellites after the '
  'following\n',
  'ternal parts of the moon as the quantities of matter in the one and in the\n'
  'other respectively ; but to the weights of the internal parts in a greater '
  'or\n'
  'less proportion, then likewise the weights of those bodies would be to the\n'
  'weight of the whole moon in a greater or less proportion; against what\n'
  'we have shewed above.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 1. Hence the weights of bodies do not depend upon their forms\n'
  'and textures ; for if the weights could be altered with the forms, they\n'
  'would be greater or less, according to the variety of forms, in equal '
  'matter ;\n'
  'altogether against experience.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 2. Universally, all bodies about the earth gravitate towards the\n'
  "earth ; and the weights of all, at equal distances from the earth's "
  'centre,\n'
  'are as the quantities of matter which they severally contain. This is the\n'
  'quality of all bodies within the reach of our experiments ; and therefore\n'
  '(by Rule III) to be affirmed of all bodies whatsoever. If the @ther, or '
  'any\n'
  'other body, were either altogether void of gravity, or were to gravitate '
  'less\n'
  'in proportion to its quantity of matter, then, because (according to Aris-\n'
  'totle, Des Cartes, and others) there is no difference betwixt that and '
  'other\n'
  'bodies but in mere form of matter, by a successive change from form to\n'
  'form, it might be changed at last into a body of the same condition with\n'
  'those which gravitate most in proportion to their quantity of matter ; '
  'and,\n'
  'on the other hand, the heaviest bodies, acquiring the first form of that\n'
  'body, might by degrees quite lose their gravity. And therefore the weights\n'
  'would depend upon the forms of bodies, and with those forms might be\n'
  'changed : contrary to what was proved in the preceding Corollary.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 3. All spaces are not equally full; for if all spaces were equally\n'
  'full, then the specific gravity of the fluid which fills the region of the '
  'air,\n'
  'on account of the extreme density of the matter, would fall nothing short\n'
  'of the specific gravity of quicksilver, or gold, or any other the most '
  'dense\n'
  'body ; and, therefore, neither gold, nor any other body, could descend in\n'
  'air ; for bodies do not descend in fluids, unless they are specifically '
  'heavier\n'
  'than the fluids. And if the quantity of matter in a given space can, by\n'
  'any rarefaction, be diminished, what should hinder a diminution to\n'
  'infinity ?\n'

  'magnetism ; for the magnetic attraction is not as the matter attracted.\n'
  'Some bodies are attracted more by the magnet; others less; most bodies\n'
  'not at all. The power of magnetism in one and the same body may be\n'

  '\n'
  '## PROPOSITION VII. THEOREM VII.\n'
  '\n'
  'That there is a power of gravity tending to all bodies, proportional to\n'
  'the several quantities of matter which they contain.\n'
  '\n'
  'That all the planets mutually gravitate one towards another, we have\n'
  'proved before ; as well as that the force of gravity towards every one of '
  'them,\n'
  'considered apart, is reciprocally as the square of the distance of places '
  'from\n'
  'the centre of the planet. And thence (by Prop. LXIX, Book I, and its\n'
  'Corollaries) it follows, that the gravity tending towards all the planets '
  'is\n'
  'proportional to the matter which they contain.\n'
  '\n'
  'Moreover, since all the parts of any planet A gravitate towards any\n'
  'other planet B; and the gravity of every part is to the gravity of the\n'
  'whole as the matter of the part to the matter of the whole ; and (by Law\n'
  'III) to every action corresponds an equal re-action ; therefore the planet '
  'B\n'
  'will, on the other hand, gravitate towards all the parts of the planet A;\n'
  'and its gravity towards any one part will be to the gravity towards the\n'
  'whole as the matter of the part to the matter of the whole. Q.E.D.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 1. Therefore the force of gravity towards any whole planet arises\n'
  'from, and is compounded of, the forces of gravity towards all its parts.\n'
  'Magnetic and electric attractions afford us examples of this; for all at-\n'
  'traction towards the whole arises from the attractions towards the several\n'
  'parts. The thing may be easily understood in gravity, if we consider a\n'
  'greater planet, as formed of a number of lesser planets, meeting together '
  'in\n'
  'one globe ; for hence it would appear that the force of the whole must\n'
  'arise from the forces of the component parts. If it is objected, that, ac-\n'
  'cording to this law, all bodies with us must mutually gravitate one to-\n'
  'wards another, whereas no such gravitation any where appears, I answer,\n'
  'that since the gravitation towards these bodies is to the gravitation '
  'towards\n'
  'the whole earth as these bodies are to the whole earth, the gravitation '
  'to-\n'
  'wards them must be far less than to fall under the observation of our '
  'senses.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 2. The force of gravity towards the several equal particles of any\n'
  'body is reciprocally as the square of the distance of places from the '

  '## PROPOSITION VIII. THEOREM VIII.\n'
  '\n'
  'In two spheres mutually gravitating each towards the other, if the matter\n'
  'in places on all sides round about and equi-distant from the centres is\n'
  'similar, the weight of either sphere towards the other will be recipro-\n'
  'cally as the square of the distance between their centres.\n'
  '\n'
  'After I had found that the force of gravity towards a whole planet did\n'
  'arise from and was compounded of the forces of gravity towards all its\n'
  'parts, and towards every one part was in the reciprocal proportion of the\n'
  'squares of the distances from the part, I was yet in doubt whether that '
  're-\n'
  'ciprocal duplicate proportion did accurately hold, or but nearly so, in '
  'the\n'
  'total force compounded of so many partial ones; for it might be that the\n'
  'proportion which accurately enough took place in greater distances should\n'
  'be wide of the truth near the surface of the planet, where the distances '
  'of\n'
  'the particles are unequal, and their situation dissimilar. But by the help\n'
  'of Prop. LXXV and LXXVI, Book I, and their Corollaries, I was at last\n'
  'satisfied of the truth of the Proposition, as it now lies before us.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 1. Hence we may find and compare together the weights of bodies\n'
  'towards different planets ; for the weights of bodies revolving in circles\n'
  'about planets are (by Cor. 2, Prop. IV, Book I) as the diameters of the\n'
  'circles directly, and the squares of their periodic times reciprocally ; '
  'and\n'
  'their weights at the surfaces of the planets, or at any other distances '
  'from\n'
  'their centres, are (by this Prop.) greater or less in the reciprocal '
  'duplicate\n'
  'proportion of the distances. Thus from the periodic times of Venus, re-\n',

  'God said, " Let NEWTON be," and all was light.\n'

  "## THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE\n"
  '\n'
  'SINCE the ancients (as we are told by Pappus), made great account of\n'
  'the science of mechanics in the investigation of natural things; and the\n'
  'moderns, laying aside substantial forms and occult qualities, have endeav-\n'
  'oured to subject the phenomena of nature to the laws of mathematics, I\n'
  'have in this treatise cultivated mathematics so far as it regards '
  'philosophy.\n'
  'The ancients considered mechanics in a twofold respect ; as rational, '
  'which\n'
  'proceeds accurately by demonstration ; and practical. To practical me-\n'
  'chanics all the manual arts belong, from which mechanics took its name.\n'
  'But as artificers do not work with perfect accuracy, it comes to pass that\n'
  'mechanics is so distinguished from geometry, that what is perfectly accu-\n'
  'rate is called geometrical ; what is less so, is called mechanical. But '
  'the\n'
  'errors are not in the art, but in the artif.cers. He that works with less\n'
  'accuracy is an imperfect mechanic; and if any could work with perfect\n'
  'accuracy, he would be the most perfect mechanic of all ; for the '
  'description\n'
  'of right lines and circles, upon which geometry is founded, belongs to me-\n'
  'chanics. Geometry does not teach us to draw these lines, but requires\n'
  'them to be drawn ; for it requires that the learner should first be taught\n'
  'to describe these accurately, before he enters upon geometry ; then it '
  'shows\n'
  'how by these operations problems may be solved. To describe right lines\n'
  "and circles are problems, but not geometrical problems. 'The solution of\n"
  'these problems is required from mechanics; and by geometry the use of\n'
  'them, when so solved, is shown ; and it is the glory of geometry that from\n'
  'those few principles, brought from without, it is able to produce so many\n'
  'things. Therefore geometry is founded in mechanical practice, and is\n'
  'nothing but that part of universal mechanics which accurately proposes\n'
  'and demonstrates the art of measuring. But since the manual arts are\n'
  'chiefly conversant in the moving of bodies, it comes to pass that geometry\n'
  'is commonly referred to their magnitudes, and mechanics to their motion.\n'
  'In this sense rational mechanics will be the science of motions resulting\n'
  'from any forces whatsoever, and of the forces required to produce any mo-\n'
  'tions, accurately proposed and demonstrated. This part of mechanics was\n'

  'cultivated by the ancients in the five powers which relate to manual arts\n'
  'who considered gravity (it not being a manual power), no otherwise than\n'
  'as it moved weights by those powers. Our design not respecting arts, but\n'
  'philosophy, and our subject not manual but natural powers, we consider\n'
  'chiefly those things which relate to gravity, levity, elastic force, the '
  'resist-\n'
  'ance of fluids, and the like forces, whether attractive or impulsive; and\n'
  'therefore we offer this work as the mathematical principles : f philosophy '
  '; for\n'
  'all the difficulty of philosophy seems to consist in this -- from the '
  'phænom-\n'
  'ena of motions to investigate the forces of nature, and then from these\n'
  'forces to demonstrate the other phenomena; and to this end the general\n'
  'propositions in the first and second book are directed. In the third book\n'
  'we give an example of this in the explication of the System of the World ;\n'
  'for by the propositions mathematically demonstrated in the former books,\n'
  'we in the third derive from the celestial phenomena the forces of gravity\n'
  'with which bodies tend to the sun and the several planets. Then from these\n'
  'forces, by other propositions which are also mathematical, we deduce the '
  'mo-\n'
  'tions of the planets, the comets, the moon, and the sea. I wish we could '
  'de-\n'
  'rive the rest of the phenomena of nature by the same kind of reasoning '
  'from\n'
  'mechanical principles ; for I am induced by many reasons to suspect that\n'
  'they may all depend upon certain forces by which the particles of bodies,\n'
  'by some causes hitherto unknown, are either mutually impelled towards\n'
  'each other, and cohere in regular figures, or are repelled and recede from\n'
  'each other; which forces being unknown, philosophers have hitherto at-\n'
  'tempted the search of nature in vain; but I hope the principles here laid\n'
  'down will afford some light either to this or some truer method of '
  'philosophy.\n'
  '\n'
  'In the publication of this work the most acute and universally learned\n'
  'Mr. Edmund Halley not only assisted me with his pains in correcting the\n'
  'press and taking care of the schemes, but it was to his solicitations that '
  'its\n'
  'becoming public is owing ; for when he had obtained of me my demonstra-\n'
  'tions of the figure of the celestial orbits, he continually pressed me to '
  'com-\n'
  'municate the same to the Royal Society, who afterwards, by their kind en-\n'
  'couragement and entreaties, engaged me to think of publishing them. But\n'

  'had entered upon some other things relating to the laws and measures of\n'

  'could put forth the whole together. What relates to the lunar motions (be-\n'

  'avoid being obliged to propose and distinctly demonstrate the several '
  'things\n'
  'there contained in a method more prolix than the subject deserved, and in-\n'
  'terrupt the series of the several propositions. Some things, found out '
  'after\n'
  'the rest, I chose to insert in places less suitable, rather than change '
  'the\n'
  'number of the propositions and the citations. I heartily beg that what 1\n'
  'have here done may be read with candour; and that the defects in a\n'
  'subject so difficult be not so much reprehended as kindly supplied, and '

  'terly void of all body and bodily figure, and can therefore neither be '
  'seen,\n'
  'nor heard, nor touched; nor ought he to be worshipped under the repre-\n'
  'sentation of any corporeal thing. We have ideas of his attributes, but\n'
  'what the real substance of any thing is we know not. In bodies, we see\n'
  'only their figures and colours, we hear only the sounds, we touch only '

  'outward surfaces, we smell only the smells, and taste the savours; but '
  'their\n'
  'inward substances are not to be known either by our senses, or by any\n'
  'reflex act of our minds : much less, then, have we any idea of the sub-\n'
  'stance of God. We know him only by his most wise and excellent con-\n'
  'trivances of things, and final causes; we admire him for his perfections ;\n'
  'but we reverence and adore him on account of his dominion : for we adore\n'
  'him as his servants; and a god without dominion, providence, and final\n'
  'causes, is nothing else but Fate and Nature. Blind metaphysical neces .\n'
  'sity, which is certainly the same always and every where, could produce\n'
  'no variety of things. All that diversity of natural things which we find\n'
  'suited to different times and places could arise from nothing but the '
  'ideas\n'
  'and will of a Being necessarily existing. But, by way of allegory, God\n'
  'is said to see, to speak, to laugh, to love, to hate, to desire, to give, '
  'to re-\n'
  'ceive, to rejoice, to be angry, to fight, to frame, to work, to build; for '
  'all\n'
  'our notions of God are taken from the ways of mankind by a certain\n'
  'similitude, which, though not perfect, has some likeness, however. And\n'
  'thus much concerning God; to discourse of whom from the appearances\n'
  'of things, does certainly belong to Natural Philosophy.\n'
  '\n'
  'Hitherto we have explained the phenomena of the heavens and of our\n'
  'sea by the power of gravity, but have not yet assigned the cause of this\n'
  'power. This is certain, that it must proceed from a cause that penetrates\n'
  'to the very centres of the sun and planets, without suffering the least\n'
  'diminution of its force ; that operates not according to the quantity of\n'
  'the surfaces of the particles upon which it acts (as mechanical causes use\n'
  'to do), but according to the quantity of the solid matter which they con-\n'
  'tain, and propagates its virtue on all sides to immense distances, '
  'decreasing\n'
  'always in the duplicate proportion of the distances. Gravitation towards\n'
  'the sun is made up out of the gravitations towards the several particles\n'
  'of which the body of the sun is composed ; and in receding from the sun\n'
  'decreases accurately in the duplicate proportion of the distances as far '
  'as\n'
  'the orb of Saturn, as evidently appears from the quiescence of the aphe-\n'
  'lions of the planets ; nay, and even to the remotest aphelions of the '
  'comets,\n'
  'if those aphelions are also quiescent. But hitherto I have not been able\n'
  'to discover the cause of those properties of gravity from phenomena, and\n'
  'I frame no hypotheses ; for whatever is not deduced from the phænomena\n'
  'is to be called an hypothesis ; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or\n'
  'physical, whether of occult qualities or mechanical, have no place in ex\n'

  'perimental philosophy. In this philosophy particular propositions are\n'
  'inferred from the phænomena, and afterwards rendered general by induo-\n'
  'tion. Thus it was that the impenetrability, the mobility, and the impul-\n'
  'sive force of bodies, and the laws of motion and of gravitation, were\n'
  'discovered. And to us it is enough that gravity does really exist, and act\n'
  'according to the laws which we have explained, and abundantly serves to\n'
  'account for all the motions of the celestial bodies, and of our sea.\n'
  '\n'
  'And now we might add something concerning a certain most subtle\n'
  'Spirit which pervades and lies hid in all gross bodies ; by the force and\n'
  'action of which Spirit the particles of bodies mutually attract one '
  'another\n'

 ['OF THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD, the constitution of the system of\n'
  'the world. In regard to this book, the author says-" I had, indeed,\n'
  'composed the third Book in a popular method, that it might be read\n'
  'by many ; but afterwards, considering that such as had not suf-\n'
  'ficently entered into the principles could not easily discover the\n'
  'strength of the consequences, nor lay aside the prejudices to which\n'
  'they had been many years accustomed, therefore, to prevent dis-\n'
  'putes which might be raised upon such accounts, I chose to reduce\n'
  'the substance of this Book into the form of Propositions (in the\n'
  'mathematical way), which should be read by those only who had\n'
  'first made themselves masters of the principles established in the\n'
  'preceding Books : not that I would advise any one to the previous\n'
  'study of every Proposition of those Books."-" It is enough it\n'
  'one carefully reads the Definitions, the Laws of Motion, and the\n'
  'three first Sections of the first Book. He may then pass on to\n'
  'this Book, and consult such of the remaining Propositions of the\n'
  'first two Books, as the references in this, and his occasions shall re-\n'
  'quire." So that " The System of the World" is composed both\n'

  "The principle of Universal Gravi' ation, namely, that every\n"
  'particle of matter is attracted by, or gravitates to, every other\n'
  'particle of matter, with a force inversely proportional to the\n'
  'squares of their distances-is the discovery which characterizes\n'
  'The PRINCIPIA. This principle the author deduced from the mo-\n'
  'tion of the moon, and the three laws of Kepler-laws, which\n'
  'Newton, in turn, by his greater law, demonstrated to be true.\n'

  'the areas to the times of their description, our author inferred\n'
  'that the force which retained the planet in its orbit was always\n'
  'directed to the sun; and from the second, namely, that every\n'
  'planet moves in an ellipse with the sun in one of its foci, he drew\n'
  'the more general inference that the force by which the planet\n'
  'moves round that focus varies inversely as the square of its dis-\n'
  'tance therefrom : and he demonstrated that a planet acted upon\n'
  'by such a force could not move in any other curve than a conic\n'
  'section ; showing when the moving body would describe a circu-\n'
  'lar, an elliptical, a parabolic, or hyperbolic orbit. He demon-\n'
  'strated, too, that this force, or attracting, gravitating power re-\n'
  'sided in every, the least particle ; but that, in spherical masses, it\n'
  'operated as if confined to their centres; so that, one sphere or\n'
  'body will act upon another sphere or body, with a force directly\n'
  'proportional to the quantity of matter, and inversely as the square\n'
  'of the distance between their centres; and that their velocities of\n'
  'mutual approach will be in the inverse ratio of their quantities of\n'
  'matter. Thus he grandly outlined the Universal Law. Verify-\n'
  'ing its truth by the motions of terrestrial bodies, then by those of\n'
  'the moon and other secondary orbs, he finally embraced, in one\n'
  'mighty generalization, the entire Solar System-all the move-\n'
  'ments of all its bodies-planets, satellites and comets-explain-\n'
  'ing and harmonizing the many diverse and theretofore inexplica-\n'
  'ble phenomena.\n'

  'sphere, body to body, particle to particle, atom to mass, the min-\n'
  'utest part to the stupendous whole-each to each, each to all,\n'
  'and all to each-in the mysterious bonds of a ceaseless, recipro-\n'
  'cal influence. An influence whose workings are shown to be\n'
  'alike present in the globular dew-drop, or oblate-spheroidal earth ;\n'
  'in the falling shower, or vast heaving ocean tides; in the flying\n'
  'thistle-down, or fixed, ponderous rock ; in the swinging pendulum,\n'
  'or time-measuring sun ; in the varying and unequal moon, or\n'
  "earth's slowly retrograding poles ; in the uncertain meteor, or\n"
  'blazing comet wheeling swiftly away on its remote, yet determined\n'
  'round. An influence, in fine, that may link system to system\n'

  "crowd heaven's fathomless deeps.\n"
  '\n'
  'And yet Newton, amid the loveliness and magnitude of Om-\n'
  'nipotence, lost not sight of the Almighty One. A secondary,\n'
  'however universal, was not taken for the First Cause. An im-\n'
  'pressed force, however diffused and powerful, assumed not the\n'
  'functions of the creating, giving Energy. Material beauties,\n'
  'splendours, and sublimities, however rich in glory, and endless in\n'
  'extent, concealed not the attributes of an intelligent Supreme.\n'
  'From the depths of his own soul, through reason and the WORD,\n'
  'he had risen, à priori, to God : from the heights of Omnipotence,\n'
  'through the design and law of the builded universe, he proved à\n'
  'posteriori, a Deity. " I had," says he, “ an eye upon such prin-\n'
  'ciples as might work, with considering men, for the belief of a\n'
  'Deity," in writing the PRINCIPIA ; at the conclusion whereof, he\n'
  'teaches that-" this most beautiful system of the sun, planets and\n'
  'comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an\n'
  'intelligent and powerful Being. And if the fixed stars are the\n'
  'centres of other like systems, these, being forme l by the like\n'
  'wise counsels, must be all subject to the dominion of One; especially\n'
  'since the light of the fixed stars is of the same nature with the\n'
  'light of the sun, and from every system light passes into all other\n'
  'systems : and lest the systems of the fixed stars should, by their\n'
  'gravity, fall on each other mutually, he hath placed those systems\n'
  'at immense distances one from another.\n'

  'The aphelions and nodes of the orbits of the planets are fixed.\n'
  '\n'
  'The aphelions are immovable by Prop. XI, Book I; and so are the\n'
  'planes of the orbits, by Prop. I of the same Book. And if the planes are\n'
  'fixed, the nodes must be so too. It is true, that some inequalities may\n'
  'arise from the mutual actions of the planets and comets in their revolu-\n'
  'tions; but these will be so small, that they may be here passed by.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 1. The fixed stars are immovable, seeing they keep the same posi-\n'
  'tion to the aphelions and nodes of the planets.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 2. And since these stars are liable to no sensible parallax from the\n'
  'annual motion of the earth, they can have no force, because of their im-\n'
  'mense distance, to produce any sensible effect in our system. Not to\n'
  'mention that the fixed stars, every where promiscuously dispersed in the\n'

  'therefore their aphelions and nodes must be fixed, excepting in so far as\n'

  '## PROPOSITION XVII. THEOREM XV.\n'
  '\n'
  'That the diurnal motions of the planets are uniform, and that the\n'
  'libration of the moon arises from its diurnal motion.\n'
  '\n'
  'The Proposition is proved from the first Law of Motion, and Cor. 22,\n'
  'Prop. 1.XVI, Book I. Jupiter, with respect to the fixed stars, revolves in\n'
  "9h. 56 ; Mars in 24h. 39'; Venus in about 23h .; the Earth in 23h. 56' ; "
  'the\n'
  "Sun in 25g days, and the moon in 27 days, 7 hours, 43'. These things\n"
  "appear by the Phenomena. The spots in the sun's body return to the\n"
  "same situation on the sun's disk, with respect to the earth, in 272 days ; "
  'and\n'
  'therefore with respect to the fixed stars the sun revolves in about 252 '
  'days.\n'
  'But because the lunar day, arising from its uniform revolution about its\n'
  'axis, is menstrual, that is, equal to the time of its periodic revolution '
  'in\n'
  'its orb, therefore the same face of the moon will be always nearly turned '
  'to\n'
  'the upper focus of its orb; but, as the situation of that focus requires, '
  'will\n'
  'deviate a little to one side and to the other from the earth in the lower\n'
  'focus; and this is the libration in longitude ; for the libration in '
  'latitude\n'
  "arises from the moon's latitude, and the inclination of its axis to the "
  'plane\n'
  'of the ecliptic. This theory of the libration of the moon, Mr. N. Mercator\n'

  'in his Astronomy, published at the beginning of the year 1676, explained\n'
  'more fully out of the letters I sent him. The utmost satellite of Saturr.\n'
  'seems to revolve about its axis with a motion like this of the moon, '
  'respect-\n'
  'ing Saturn continually with the same face; for in its revolution round\n'
  'Saturn, as often as it comes to the eastern part of its orbit, it is '
  'scarcely\n'
  'visible, and generally quite disappears ; which is like to be occasioned '
  'by\n'
  'some spots in that part of its body, which is then turned towards the '
  'earth,\n'
  'as M. Cassini has observed. So also the utmost satellite of Jupiter seems\n'
  'to revolve about its axis with a like motion, because in that part of its '
  'body\n'
  'which is turned from Jupiter it has a spot, which always appears as if it\n'
  "were in Jupiter's own body, whenever the satellite passes between Jupiter\n"
  'and our eye.\n'

  '## PROPOSITION XVIII. THEOREM XVI.\n'
  '\n'
  "'That the axes of the planets are less than the diameters drawn perpen-\n"
  'dicular to the axes.\n'
  '\n'
  'The equal gravitation of the parts on all sides would give a spherical\n'
  'figure to the planets, if it was not for their diurnal revolution in a '
  'circle.\n'
  'By that circular motion it comes to pass that the parts receding from the\n'
  'axis endeavour to ascend about the equator ; and therefore if the matter '
  'is\n'
  'in a fluid state, by its ascent towards the equator it will enlarge the '
  'di-\n'
  'ameters there, and by its descent towards the poles it will shorten the '
  'axis.\n'
  'So the diameter of Jupiter (by the concurring observations of astronomers)\n'
  'is found shorter betwixt pole and pole than from east to west. And, by\n'
  'the same argument, if our earth was not higher about the equator than at\n',
  'parts become greater ; and the inequality of the proportion is also '
  'greater.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 2. But the perturbation will be greatest of all, if we suppose the\n'
  'accelerative attractions of the parts of the system towards the greatest '
  'body\n'
  'of all are not to each other reciprocally as the squares of the distances\n'
  'from that great body ; especially if the inequality of this proportion be\n'
  'greater than the inequality of the proportion of the distances from the\n'
  'great body. For if the accelerative force, acting in parallel directions\n'
  'and equally, causes no perturbation in the motions of the parts of the\n'
  'system, it must of course, when it acts unequally, cause a perturbation '
  'some-\n'
  'where, which will be greater or less as the inequality is greater or less.\n'
  'The excess of the greater impulses acting upon some bodies, and not acting\n'
  'upon others, must necessarily change their situation among themselves. And\n'
  'this perturbation, added to the perturbation arising from the inequality\n'
  'and inclination of the lines, makes the whole perturbation greater.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. ?. Hence if the parts of this system move in ellipses or circles\n'
  'without any remarkable perturbation, it is manifest that, if they are at '
  'all\n'
  'impelled by accelerative forces tending to any other bodies, the impulse '
  'is\n'
  'very weak, or else is impressed very near equally and in parallel '
  'directions\n'

  '# PROPOSITION LXVI. THEOREM XXVI.\n'
  '\n'
  'If three bodies whose forces decrease in a duplicate ratio of the '
  'distances\n'
  'attract each other mutually ; and the accelerative attractions of any\n'
  'two towards the third be between themselves reciprocally as the squares\n'
  'of the distances ; and the two least revolve about the greatest ; I say,\n'
  'that the interior of the two revolving bodies will, by radii drawn to the\n'
  'innermost and greatest, describe round that body areas more propor-\n'
  'tional to the times, and a figure more approaching to that of an ellip-\n'

  'ed (by Cor. 2. of the Laws of Motion) into the attractions SM, LM. And\n'
  'so the body P will be urged with a threefold accelerative force. One of\n'
  'these forces tends towards T, and arises from the mutual attraction of the\n'
  'bodies T and P. By this force alone the body P would describe round the\n'
  'body T, by the radius PT, areas proportional to the times, and an\n'
  'ellipsis whose focus is in the centre of the body T; and this it would do\n'
  "whether the body 'T remained unmoved, or whether it were agitated by that\n"
  'attraction. This appears from Prop. XI, and Cor. 2 and 3 of Theor.\n'
  'XXI. The other force is that of the attraction LM, which, because it\n'
  'tends from P to T, will be superadded to and coincide with the former\n'
  'force ; and cause the areas to be still proportional to the times, by Cor. '
  '3,\n'
  'Theor. XXI. But because it is not reciprocally proportional to the square\n'
  'of the distance PT, it will compose, when added to the former, a force\n'
  'varying from that proportion ; which variation will be the greater by how\n'
  'much the proportion of this force to the former is greater, cæteris '
  'paribus.\n'
  "'Therefore, since by Prop. XI, and by Cor. 2, Theor. XXI, the force with\n"
  'which the ellipsis is described about the focus T ought to be directed to\n'
  'that focus, and to be reciprocally proportional to the square of the '
  'distance\n'
  'PT, that compounded force varying from that proportion will make the\n'
  'orbit PAB vary from the figure of an ellipsis that has its focus in the '
  'point\n'
  'T; and so much the more by how much the variation from that proportion\n'
  'is greater ; and by consequence by how much the proportion of the second\n'
  'force LM to the first force is greater, cæteris paribus. But now the third\n'
  'force SM, attracting the body P in a direction parallel to ST, composes '
  'with\n'
  'the other forces a new force which is no longer directed from Pto T; and '
  'which\n'
  'varies so much more from this direction by how much the proportion of this\n'
  'third force to the other forces is greater, cæteris paribus ; and therefore '
  'causes\n'
  'the body P to describe, by the radius TP, areas no longer proportional to '
  'the\n'
  'times ; and therefore makes the variation from that proportionality so '
  'much\n'
  'greater by how much the proportion of this force to the others is greater.\n'

  'premised, it is manifest that the areas are then most nearly proportional '
  'to\n'
  'the times, when that third force is the least possible, the rest '
  'preserving\n'
  'their former quantity ; and that the orbit PAB does then approach nearest\n'

  "Let the accelerative attraction of the body 'T towards S be expressed by\n"
  'the line SN ; then if the accelerative attractions SM and SN were equal,\n'
  "these, attracting the bodies 'T and P equally and in parallel directions\n"
  'would not at all change their situation with respect to each other. The '
  'mo-\n'
  'tions of the bodies between themselves would be the same in that case as '
  'if\n'
  'those attractions did not act at all, by Cor. 6, of the Laws of Motion. '
  'And,\n'
  'by a like reasoning, if the attraction SN is less than the attraction SM, '
  'it\n'
  'will take away out of the attraction SM the part SN, so that there will '
  're-\n'
  'main only the part (of the attraction) MN to disturb the proportionality '
  'of\n'
  'the areas and times, and the elliptical figure of the orbit. And in like\n'
  'manner if the attraction SN be greater than the attraction SM, the pertur-\n'
  'bation of the orbit and proportion will be produced by the difference MN\n'
  'alone. After this manner the attraction SN reduces always the attraction\n'
  'SM to the attraction MN, the first and second attractions rema ning per-\n',
  'ternal parts of the moon as the quantities of matter in the one and in the\n'
  'other respectively ; but to the weights of the internal parts in a greater '
  'or\n'
  'less proportion, then likewise the weights of those bodies would be to the\n'
  'weight of the whole moon in a greater or less proportion; against what\n'
  'we have shewed above.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 1. Hence the weights of bodies do not depend upon their forms\n'
  'and textures ; for if the weights could be altered with the forms, they\n'
  'would be greater or less, according to the variety of forms, in equal '
  'matter ;\n'
  'altogether against experience.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 2. Universally, all bodies about the earth gravitate towards the\n'
  "earth ; and the weights of all, at equal distances from the earth's "
  'centre,\n'
  'are as the quantities of matter which they severally contain. This is the\n'
  'quality of all bodies within the reach of our experiments ; and therefore\n'
  '(by Rule III) to be affirmed of all bodies whatsoever. If the @ther, or '
  'any\n'
  'other body, were either altogether void of gravity, or were to gravitate '
  'less\n'
  'in proportion to its quantity of matter, then, because (according to Aris-\n'
  'totle, Des Cartes, and others) there is no difference betwixt that and '
  'other\n'
  'bodies but in mere form of matter, by a successive change from form to\n'
  'form, it might be changed at last into a body of the same condition with\n'
  'those which gravitate most in proportion to their quantity of matter ; '
  'and,\n'
  'on the other hand, the heaviest bodies, acquiring the first form of that\n'
  'body, might by degrees quite lose their gravity. And therefore the weights\n'
  'would depend upon the forms of bodies, and with those forms might be\n'
  'changed : contrary to what was proved in the preceding Corollary.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 3. All spaces are not equally full; for if all spaces were equally\n'
  'full, then the specific gravity of the fluid which fills the region of the '
  'air,\n'
  'on account of the extreme density of the matter, would fall nothing short\n'
  'of the specific gravity of quicksilver, or gold, or any other the most '
  'dense\n'
  'body ; and, therefore, neither gold, nor any other body, could descend in\n'
  'air ; for bodies do not descend in fluids, unless they are specifically '
  'heavier\n'
  'than the fluids. And if the quantity of matter in a given space can, by\n'
  'any rarefaction, be diminished, what should hinder a diminution to\n'
  'infinity ?\n'

  'magnetism ; for the magnetic attraction is not as the matter attracted.\n'
  'Some bodies are attracted more by the magnet; others less; most bodies\n'
  'not at all. The power of magnetism in one and the same body may be\n'
  'increased and diminished ; and is sometimes far stronger, for the quantity\n'

  '\n'
  '## PROPOSITION VII. THEOREM VII.\n'
  '\n'
  'That there is a power of gravity tending to all bodies, proportional to\n'
  'the several quantities of matter which they contain.\n'
  '\n'
  'That all the planets mutually gravitate one towards another, we have\n'
  'proved before ; as well as that the force of gravity towards every one of '
  'them,\n'
  'considered apart, is reciprocally as the square of the distance of places '
  'from\n'
  'the centre of the planet. And thence (by Prop. LXIX, Book I, and its\n'
  'Corollaries) it follows, that the gravity tending towards all the planets '
  'is\n'
  'proportional to the matter which they contain.\n'
  '\n'
  'Moreover, since all the parts of any planet A gravitate towards any\n'
  'other planet B; and the gravity of every part is to the gravity of the\n'
  'whole as the matter of the part to the matter of the whole ; and (by Law\n'
  'III) to every action corresponds an equal re-action ; therefore the planet '
  'B\n'
  'will, on the other hand, gravitate towards all the parts of the planet A;\n'
  'and its gravity towards any one part will be to the gravity towards the\n'
  'whole as the matter of the part to the matter of the whole. Q.E.D.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 1. Therefore the force of gravity towards any whole planet arises\n'
  'from, and is compounded of, the forces of gravity towards all its parts.\n'
  'Magnetic and electric attractions afford us examples of this; for all at-\n'
  'traction towards the whole arises from the attractions towards the several\n'
  'parts. The thing may be easily understood in gravity, if we consider a\n'
  'greater planet, as formed of a number of lesser planets, meeting together '
  'in\n'
  'one globe ; for hence it would appear that the force of the whole must\n'
  'arise from the forces of the component parts. If it is objected, that, ac-\n'
  'cording to this law, all bodies with us must mutually gravitate one to-\n'
  'wards another, whereas no such gravitation any where appears, I answer,\n'
  'that since the gravitation towards these bodies is to the gravitation '
  'towards\n'
  'the whole earth as these bodies are to the whole earth, the gravitation '
  'to-\n'
  'wards them must be far less than to fall under the observation of our '
  'senses.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 2. The force of gravity towards the several equal particles of any\n'
  'body is reciprocally as the square of the distance of places from the '
  'parti-\n'
  'cles ; as appears from Cor. 3, Prop. LX.XIV, Book I.\n'

  '## PROPOSITION VIII. THEOREM VIII.\n'
  '\n'
  'In two spheres mutually gravitating each towards the other, if the matter\n'
  'in places on all sides round about and equi-distant from the centres is\n'
  'similar, the weight of either sphere towards the other will be recipro-\n'
  'cally as the square of the distance between their centres.\n'
  '\n'
  'After I had found that the force of gravity towards a whole planet did\n'
  'arise from and was compounded of the forces of gravity towards all its\n'
  'parts, and towards every one part was in the reciprocal proportion of the\n'
  'squares of the distances from the part, I was yet in doubt whether that '
  're-\n'
  'ciprocal duplicate proportion did accurately hold, or but nearly so, in '
  'the\n'
  'total force compounded of so many partial ones; for it might be that the\n'
  'proportion which accurately enough took place in greater distances should\n'
  'be wide of the truth near the surface of the planet, where the distances '
  'of\n'
  'the particles are unequal, and their situation dissimilar. But by the help\n'
  'of Prop. LXXV and LXXVI, Book I, and their Corollaries, I was at last\n'
  'satisfied of the truth of the Proposition, as it now lies before us.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 1. Hence we may find and compare together the weights of bodies\n'
  'towards different planets ; for the weights of bodies revolving in circles\n'
  'about planets are (by Cor. 2, Prop. IV, Book I) as the diameters of the\n'
  'circles directly, and the squares of their periodic times reciprocally ; '
  'and\n'
  'their weights at the surfaces of the planets, or at any other distances '

  'their centres, are (by this Prop.) greater or less in the reciprocal '

  'luminous in the certain splendour of demonstrated truth. And\n'
  'this ablest man had come-was here. His mind, familiar with\n'
  'the knowledge of past effort, and its unequalled faculties develop-\n'
  'ed in transcendant strength, was now moving on to the very\n'
  'threshold of its grandest achievement. Step by step the untrod-\n'
  'den path was measured, till, at length, the entrance seemed dis-\n'
  'closed, and the tireless explorer to stand amid the first opening\n'
  'wonders of the universe.\n'
  '\n'
  'The nature of gravity-that mysterious power which causes\n'
  'all bodies to descend towards the centre of the earth-had, in-\n'
  'deed, dawned upon him. And reason busily united link to link\n'
  'of that chain which was yet to be traced joining the least to the\n'
  'vastest, the most remote to the nearest, in one harmonious bond.\n'
  'From the bottoms of the deepest caverns to the summits of the\n'
  'highest mountains, this power suffers no sensible change : may not\n'
  'its action, then, extend to the moon ? Undoubtedly : and further\n'
  'reflection convinced him that such a power might be sufficient for\n'
  'retaining that luminary in her orbit round the earth. But, though\n'
  'this power suffers no sensible variation, in the little change of\n'
  "distance from the earth's centre, at which we may place our-\n"
  '"elves, yet, at the distance of the moon, may not its force undergo\n'

  '\n'
  'more or less diminution ? The conjecture appeared most proba-\n'
  'ble : and, in order to estimate what the degree of diminution\n'
  'might be, he considered that if the moon be retained in her orbit\n'
  'by the force of gravity, the primary planets must also be carried\n'
  'round the sun by the like power ; and, by comparing the periods\n'
  'of the several planets with their distances from the sun, he found\n'
  'that, if they were held in their courses by any power like gravity,\n'
  'its strength must decrease in the duplicate proportion of the in-\n'
  'crease of distance. In forming this conclusion, he supposed the\n'
  'planets to move in perfect circles, concentric to the sun. Now\n'
  "was this the law of the moon's motion ? Was such a force, em-\n"
  'anating from the earth and directed to the moon, sufficient, when\n'
  'diminished as the square of the distance, to retain her in her\n'
  'orbit ? To ascertain this master-fact, he compared the space\n'
  'through which heavy bodies fall, in a second of time, at a given\n'
  'distance from the centre of the earth, namely, at its surface, with\n'
  'the space through which the moon falls, as it were, to the earth,\n'
  'in the same time, while revolving in a circular orbit. He was\n'
  'absent from books; and, therefore, adopted, in computing the\n'
  "earth's diameter, the common estimate of sixty miles to a degree\n"
  'of latitude as then in use among geographers and navigators.\n'
  'The result of his calculations did not, of course, answer his ex-\n'
  'pectations ; hence, he concluded that some other cause, beyond the\n'
  'reach of observation-analogous, perhaps, to the vortices of Des-\n'
  'cartes-joined its action to that of the power of gravity upon the\n'
  'moon. Though by no means satisfied, he yet abandoned awhile\n'
  'further inquiry, and remained totally silent upon the subject.\n'
  '\n'
  'These rapid marches in the career of discovery, combined with\n'
  'the youth of Newton, seem to evince a penetration the most\n'
  'lively, and an invention the most exuberant. But in him there\n'
  'was a conjunction of influences as extraordinary as fortunate.\n'
  'Study, unbroker, persevering and profound carried on its inform-\n'
  'ing and disciplming work upon a genius, natively the greatest,\n'
  'and rendered freest in its movements, and clearest in its vision,\n'
  'through the untrammelling and enligt tening power of religion.\n'
  'And, in this happy concurrence, are to be sought the elements of\n'
  'those amazing abilities, which, grasping, with equal facility, the\n'

  'minute and the stupendous, brought these successively to light,\n'
  'and caused science to make them her own.\n'
  '\n'
  'In 1667, Newton was made a Junior Fellow ; and, in the year\n'
  'following, he took his degree of Master of Arts, and was appoint-\n'
  'ed to a Senior Fellowship.\n'
  '\n'
  'On his return to Cambridge, in 1668, he resumed his optical\n'
  'labours. Having thought of a delicate method of polishing metal,\n'
  'he proceeded to the construction of his newly projected reflect.\n'
  'ing telescope ; a small specimen of which he actually made with\n'
  'his own hands. It was six inches long ; and magnified about\n'
  'forty times ;- a power greater than a refracting instrument of six\n'
  'feet tube could exert with distinctness. Jupiter, with his four\n'
  'satellites, and the horns, or moon-like phases of Venus were\n'
  'plainly visible through it. THIS WAS THE FIRST REFLECTING\n'
  'TELESCOPE EVER EXECUTED AND DIRECTED TO THE HEAVENS.\n'
  'He gave an account of it, in a letter to a friend, dated February 23d,\n'
  '1668-9-a letter which is also remarkable for containing the first\n'
  'allusion to his discoveries " concerning the nature of light." En-\n'
  'couraged by the success of his first experiment, he again executed\n'
  'with his own hands, not long afterward, a second and superior\n'
  'instrument of the same kind. The existence of this having come\n'
  'to the knowledge of the Royal Society of London, in 1671, they\n'
  'requested it of Newton for examination. He accordingly sent it\n'
  'to them. It excited great admiration ; it was shown to the king ·\n'
  'a drawing and description of it was sent to Paris; and the tele-\n'
  'scope itself was carefully preserved in the Library of the Society.\n'
  'Newton lived to see his invention in public use, and of eminent\n'
  'service in the cause of science.\n'
  '\n'
  'In the spring of 1669, he wrote to his friend Francis Aston,\n'
  'Esq., then about setting out on his travels, a letter of advice and\n'
  'directions, it was dated May 18th, and is interesting as exhibit-\n'],
 ['\n'
  'In June, 1709, Newton intrusted the superintendence of a\n'
  'second edition of the PRINCIPIA to Roger Cotes, Plumian Pro-\n'
  'fessor of Astronomy at Cambridge. The first edition had been\n'
  'sold off for some time. Copies of the work had become very\n'
  'rare, and could only be obtained at several times their original\n'
  'cost. A great number of letters passed between the author and\n'
  'Mr. Cotes during the preparation of the edition, which finally\n'
  'appeared in May, 1713. It had many alterations and improve-\n'
  'ments, and was accompanied by an admirable Preface from the\n'

  "It is a notable fact, in Newton's history, that he never volun-\n"
  'tarily published any one of his purely mathematical writings\n'
  'The cause of this unwillingness in some, and, in other instances,\n'
  'of his indifference, or, at least, want of solicitude to put forth his\n'
  'works may be confidently sought for in his repugnance to every-\n'
  'thing like contest or dispute. But, going deeper than this aver-\n'
  'sion, we find, underlying his whole character and running parallel\n'
  'with all his discoveries, that extraordinary humility which always\n'
  'preserved him in a position so relatively just to the behests of\n'
  'time and eternity, that the infinite value of truth, and the utter\n'
  'worthlessness of fame, were alike constantly present to him.\n'
  'Judging of his course, however, in its more temporary aspect, as\n'
  'bearing upon his immediate quiet, it seemed the most unfortunate.\n'
  'For an early publication, especially in the case of his Method of\n'
  'Fluxions, would have anticipated all rivalry, and secured him\n'
  'from the contentious claims of Leibnitz. Still each one will solve\n'
  'the problem of his existence in his own way, and, with a man like\n'
  'Newton, his own, as we conceive, could be no other than the best\n'
  'way. The conduct of Leibnitz in this affair is quite irreconcilable\n'
  'with the stature and strength of the man ; giant-like, and doing\n'
  "nobly, in many ways, a giant's work, yet cringing himself into the\n"
  'dimensions and performances of a common calumniator. Opening\n'
  'in 1699, the discussion in question continued till the close of\n'
  "Leibnitz's life, in 1716. We give the summary of the case as\n"

  '"I. Mr. Leibnitz was in London in the beginning of the year\n'
  '1673 ; and went thence in or about March, to Paris, where he\n'
  'kept a correspondence with Mr. Collins, by means of Mr. Olden-\n'
  'burg, till about September, 1676, and then returned, by London\n'
  'and Amsterdam, to Hanover : and that Mr. Collins was very free\n'
  'in communicating to able mathematicians what he had received\n'
  'from Mr. Newton and Mr. Gregory.\n'
  '\n'
  '"II. That when Mr. Leibnitz was the first time in London,\n'
  'he contended for the invention of another differential method,\n'
  'properly so called ; and, notwithstanding he was shown by Dr.\n'
  "Pell that it was Newton's method, persisted in maintaining it to\n"
  'be his own invention, by reason that he had found it by himself\n'
  'without knowing what Newton had done before, and had much\n'
  'improved it. And we find no mention of his having any other\n'
  "differential method than Newton's before his letter of the 21st of\n"
  "June, 1677, which was a year after a copy of Mr. Newton's letter\n"
  'of the 10th of December, 1672, had been sent to Paris to be\n'
  'communicated to him ; and above four years after Mr. Collins\n'
  'began to communicate that letter to his correspondents ; in which\n'
  'letter the method of fluxions was sufficiently described to any\n'
  'intelligent person.\n'
  '\n'
  '"III. That by Mr. Newton\'s letter, of the 13th of June, 1676\n'
  'it appears that he had the method of fluxions above five years\n'
  'before the writing of that letter. And by his Analysis per Æqua-\n'
  'tiones numero Terminorum Infinitas, communicated by Dr. Barrow\n'
  'to Mr. Collins, in July, 1669, we find that he had invented the\n'
  'method before that time.\n'

  "## THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE\n"
  '\n'
  'SINCE the ancients (as we are told by Pappus), made great account of\n'
  'the science of mechanics in the investigation of natural things; and the\n'
  'moderns, laying aside substantial forms and occult qualities, have endeav-\n'
  'oured to subject the phenomena of nature to the laws of mathematics, I\n'
  'have in this treatise cultivated mathematics so far as it regards '
  'philosophy.\n'
  'The ancients considered mechanics in a twofold respect ; as rational, '
  'which\n'
  'proceeds accurately by demonstration ; and practical. To practical me-\n'
  'chanics all the manual arts belong, from which mechanics took its name.\n'
  'But as artificers do not work with perfect accuracy, it comes to pass that\n'
  'mechanics is so distinguished from geometry, that what is perfectly accu-\n'
  'rate is called geometrical ; what is less so, is called mechanical. But '
  'the\n'
  'errors are not in the art, but in the artif.cers. He that works with less\n'
  'accuracy is an imperfect mechanic; and if any could work with perfect\n'
  'accuracy, he would be the most perfect mechanic of all ; for the '
  'description\n'
  'of right lines and circles, upon which geometry is founded, belongs to me-\n'
  'chanics. Geometry does not teach us to draw these lines, but requires\n'
  'them to be drawn ; for it requires that the learner should first be taught\n'
  'to describe these accurately, before he enters upon geometry ; then it '
  'shows\n'
  'how by these operations problems may be solved. To describe right lines\n'
  "and circles are problems, but not geometrical problems. 'The solution of\n"
  'these problems is required from mechanics; and by geometry the use of\n'
  'them, when so solved, is shown ; and it is the glory of geometry that from\n'
  'those few principles, brought from without, it is able to produce so many\n'
  'things. Therefore geometry is founded in mechanical practice, and is\n'
  'nothing but that part of universal mechanics which accurately proposes\n'
  'and demonstrates the art of measuring. But since the manual arts are\n'
  'chiefly conversant in the moving of bodies, it comes to pass that geometry\n'
  'is commonly referred to their magnitudes, and mechanics to their motion.\n'
  'In this sense rational mechanics will be the science of motions resulting\n'
  'from any forces whatsoever, and of the forces required to produce any mo-\n'
  'tions, accurately proposed and demonstrated. This part of mechanics was\n'

  '\n'
  'cultivated by the ancients in the five powers which relate to manual arts\n'
  'who considered gravity (it not being a manual power), no otherwise than\n'
  'as it moved weights by those powers. Our design not respecting arts, but\n'
  'philosophy, and our subject not manual but natural powers, we consider\n'
  'chiefly those things which relate to gravity, levity, elastic force, the '
  'resist-\n'
  'ance of fluids, and the like forces, whether attractive or impulsive; and\n'
  'therefore we offer this work as the mathematical principles : f philosophy '
  '; for\n'
  'all the difficulty of philosophy seems to consist in this -- from the '
  'phænom-\n'
  'ena of motions to investigate the forces of nature, and then from these\n'
  'forces to demonstrate the other phenomena; and to this end the general\n'
  'propositions in the first and second book are directed. In the third book\n'
  'we give an example of this in the explication of the System of the World ;\n'
  'for by the propositions mathematically demonstrated in the former books,\n'
  'we in the third derive from the celestial phenomena the forces of gravity\n'
  'with which bodies tend to the sun and the several planets. Then from these\n'
  'forces, by other propositions which are also mathematical, we deduce the '
  'mo-\n'
  'tions of the planets, the comets, the moon, and the sea. I wish we could '
  'de-\n'
  'rive the rest of the phenomena of nature by the same kind of reasoning '
  'from\n'
  'mechanical principles ; for I am induced by many reasons to suspect that\n'
  'they may all depend upon certain forces by which the particles of bodies,\n'
  'by some causes hitherto unknown, are either mutually impelled towards\n'
  'each other, and cohere in regular figures, or are repelled and recede from\n'
  'each other; which forces being unknown, philosophers have hitherto at-\n'
  'tempted the search of nature in vain; but I hope the principles here laid\n'
  'down will afford some light either to this or some truer method of '
  'philosophy.\n'
  '\n'
  'In the publication of this work the most acute and universally learned\n'
  'Mr. Edmund Halley not only assisted me with his pains in correcting the\n'
  'press and taking care of the schemes, but it was to his solicitations that '
  'its\n'
  'becoming public is owing ; for when he had obtained of me my demonstra-\n'
  'tions of the figure of the celestial orbits, he continually pressed me to '
  'com-\n'
  'municate the same to the Royal Society, who afterwards, by their kind en-\n'
  'couragement and entreaties, engaged me to think of publishing them. But\n'
  'after I had begun to consider the inequalities of the lunar motions, and\n'
  'had entered upon some other things relating to the laws and measures of\n'
  'gravity, and other forces ; and the figures that would be described by '
  'bodie?\n'
  'attracted according to given laws ; and the motion of several bodies '
  'moving\n'
  'among themselves ; the motion of bodies in resisting mediums; the forces,\n'
  'densities, and motions, of m‹ liums ; the orbits of the comets, and such '
  'like ;\n'

  'deferred that publication till I had made a search into those matters, and\n'
  'could put forth the whole together. What relates to the lunar motions (be-\n'
  'ing imperfect), I have put all together in the corollaries of Prop. 66, to\n'
  'avoid being obliged to propose and distinctly demonstrate the several '
  'things\n'
  'there contained in a method more prolix than the subject deserved, and in-\n'
  'terrupt the series of the several propositions. Some things, found out '
  'after\n'
  'the rest, I chose to insert in places less suitable, rather than change '
  'the\n'
  'number of the propositions and the citations. I heartily beg that what 1\n'
  'have here done may be read with candour; and that the defects in a\n'
  'subject so difficult be not so much reprehended as kindly supplied, and '
  'in-\n'
  'vestigated by new endeavours of my readers.\n'

  'In the second edition the second section of the first book was enlarged.\n'
  'In the seventh section of the second book the theory of the resistances of '
  'fluids\n'
  'was more accurately investigated, and confirmed by new experiments. In\n'
  "the third book the moon's theory and the præcession of the equinoxes were\n"
  'more fully deduced from their principles; and the theory of the comets\n'
  'was confirmed by more examples of the calculation of their orbits, done\n'
  'also with greater accuracy.\n'

  'obstacles to the wide circulation of the work. It is now, how-\n'

  'otherwise, to render the First American Edition the most accurate\n'

  'set up. The PRINCIPIA, above all, glows with the immortality of\n'
  'a transcendant mind. Marble and brass dissolve and pass away ;\n'
  'but the true creations of genius endure, in time and beyond time,\n'
  'forever : high upon the adamant of the indestructible, they send\n'
  'forth afar and near, over the troublous waters of life, a pure, un-\n'
  'wavering. quenchless light whereby the myriad myriads of barques,\n'
  'richly laden with reason, intelligence and various faculty, are\n'
  'guided through the night and the storm, by the beetling shore\n'
  'and the hidden rock, the breaker and the shoal, safely into havens\n'

  '\n'
  'To the teacher and the taught, the scholar and the student, the\n'
  'devotee of Science and the worshipper of Truth, the PRINCIPIA\n'
  'must ever continue to be of inestimable value. If to educate\n'
  'means, not so much to store the memory with symbols and facts,\n'
  'as to bring forth the faculties of the soul and develope them to the\n'
  'full by healthy nurture and a hardy discipline, then, what so effec-\n'
  'tive to the accomplishment of that end as the study of Geometri-\n'
  'cal Synthesis ? The Calculus, in some shape or other, is, indeed,\n'
  'necessary to the successful prosecution of researches in the higher\n'
  'branches of philosophy. But has not the Analytical encroached\n'
  'upon the Synthetical, and Algorithmic Formulæ been employed\n'
  'when not requisite, either for the evolution of truth, or even its\n'
  'apter illustration ? To each method belongs, undoubtedly, an\n'
  'appropriate use. Newton, himself the inventor of Fluxions,\n'
  'censured the handling of Geometrical subjects by Algebraical\n'
  'calculations ; and the maturest opinions which he expressed were\n'
  'additionally in favour of the Geometrical Method. His prefer-\n'
  'ence, so strongly marked, is not to be reckoned a mere matter of\n'
  'taste ; and his authority should bear with preponderating weight\n'
  'upon the decision of every instructor in adopting what may be\n'
  'deemed the best plan to insure the completest mental develop-\n'

  'which all things are. Plainly, therefore, this noble study has\n'
  'other and infinitely higher uses than to increase the power of ab-\n'
  'straction. A more general and thorough cultivation of it should\n'
  'De strenuously insisted on. Passing from the pages of Euclid or\n'
  'Legendre, might not the student be led, at the suitable time, to\n'

  "FROM the thick darkness of the middle ages man's struggling\n"
  'spirit emerged as in new birth ; breaking out of the iron control\n'
  'of that period ; growing strong and confident in the tug and din\n'
  'of succeeding conflict and revolution, it bounded forwards and\n'
  'upwards with resistless vigour to the investigation of physical and\n'
  'moral truth ; ascending height after height ; sweeping afar over\n'
  'the earth, penetrating afar up into the heavens ; increasing in en-\n'
  'deavour, enlarging in endowment ; every where boldly, earnestly\n'
  'vut-stretching, till, in the AUTHOR of the PRINCIPIA, one arose,\n'
  'who, grasping the master-key of the universe and treading its\n'
  'celestial paths, opened up to the human intellect the stupendous\n'
  'realities of the material world, and, in the unrolling of its harmo-\n'
  'nies, gave to the human heart a new song to the goodness, wis-\n'
  'dom, and majesty of the all-creating, all-sustaining, all-perfect\n'
  'God.\n'
  '\n'
  'Sir Isaac Newton, in whom the rising intellect seemed to attain,\n'
  'as it were, to its culminating point, was born on the 25th of De-\n'
  'cember, O. S. 1642-Christmas day-at Woolsthorpe, in the\n'
  'parish of Colsterworth, in Lincolnshire. His father, John New-\n'
  'ton, died at the age of thirty-six, and only a few months after his\n'
  'marriage to Harriet Ayscough, daughter of James Ayscough, of\n'
  'Rutlandshire. Mrs. Newton, probably wrought upon by the\n'
  'early loss of her husband, gave premature birth to her only and\n'
  'posthumous child, of which, too, from its extreme diminutiveness,\n'
  'she appeared likely to be soon bereft. Happily, it was otherwise\n'
  'decreed! The tiny infant, on whose little lips the breath of life\n'

  'so doubtingly hovered, lived ;- lived to a vigorous maturity, to a\n'
  'hale old age ;- lived to become the boast of his country, the won-\n'
  'der of his time, and the " ornament of his species."\n'
  '\n'
  'Beyond the grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir\n'
  'Isaac cannot with certainty be traced. ',
  'the thick rushing, stupendous results overpowered him ; he be-\n'
  'came unable to carry on the process of calculation, and intrusted\n'
  'its completion to one of his friends. The discoverer had, indeed,\n'
  "grasped the master-fact. The law of falling bodies at the earth's\n"
  'surface was at length identified with that which guided the moon\n'
  'in her orbit. And so his GREAT THOUGHT, that had for sixteen\n'
  'years loomed up in dim, gigantic outline, amid the first dawn of a\n'
  'plausible hypothesis, now stood forth, radiant and not less grand,\n'
  'in the mid-day light of demonstrated truth.\n'
  '\n'
  'It were difficult, nay impossible to imagine, even, the influence\n'
  "of a result like this upon a mind like Newton's. It was as if the\n"
  'keystone had been fitted to the glorious arch by which his spirit\n'
  'should ascend to the outskirts of infinite space-spanning the immea-\n'
  'surable-weighing the imponderable-computing the incalculable\n'
  '-mapping out the marchings of the planets, and the far-wander-\n'
  'ings of the comets, and catching, bring back to earth some clearer\n'
  'notes of that higher melody which, as a sounding voice, bears\n'
  'perpetual witness to the design and omnipotence of a creating\n'
  'Deity.\n'
  '\n'
  'Newton, extending the law thus obtained, composed a series\n'
  'of about twelve propositions on the motion of the primary planets\n'

  'about the sun. These were sent to London, and communicated\n'
  'to the Royal Society about the end of 1683. At or near this pe-\n'
  'riod, other philosophers, as Sir Christopher Wren, Dr. Halley,\n'
  'and Dr. Hooke, were engaged in investigating the same subject ;\n'
  'but with no definite or satisfactory results. Dr. Halley, having\n'
  "seen, it is presumed, our author's propositions, went in August,\n"
  '1684, to Cambridge to consult with him upon the subject.\n'
  'Newton assured him that he had brought the demonstration to\n'
  'perfection. In November, Dr. Halley received a copy of the\n'
  'work ; and, in the following month, announced it to the Royal\n'
  "Society, with the author's promise to have it entered upon their\n"
  'Register. Newton, subsequently reminded by the Society of his\n'
  'promise, proceeded in the diligent preparation of the work, and,\n'
  'though suffering an interruption of six weeks, transmitted the\n'
  'manuscript of the first book to London before the end of April.\n'
  'The work was entitled PHILOSOPHIE NATURALIS PRINCIPIA\n'
  'MATHEMATICA, dedicated to the Royal Society, and presented\n'
  'thereto on the 28th of April, 1685-6. The highest encomiums\n'
  'were passed upon it ; and the council resolved, on the 19th of\n'
  'May, to print it at the expense of the Society, and under the di-\n'
  'rection of Dr. Halley. The latter, a few days afterward, com-\n'
  'municated these steps to Newton, who, in a reply, dated the 20th\n'
  'of June, holds the following language :- " The proof you sent me\n'
  'I like very well. I designed the whole to consist of three books ;\n'
  'the second was finished last summer, being short, and only wants\n'
  'transcribing, and drawing the cuts fairly. Some new propositions\n'
  'I have since thought on, which I can as well let alone. The\n'
  'third wants the theory of comets. In autumn last, I spent two\n'
  'months in calculation to no purpose for want of a good method.\n'
  'which made me afterward return to the first book, and enlarge it\n'
  'with diverse propositions, somé relating to comets, others to other\n'
  'things found out last winter. The third I now design to sup-\n'
  'press. Philosophy is such an impertinently litigious lady, that a\n'
  'man had as good be engaged in law-suits as have to do with her.\n'
  'I found it so formerly, and now I can no sooner come near her\n'
  'again, but she gives me warning. The first two books without\n'
  'the third will not so well bear the title of Philosophie Naturalis\n'

  'Principia Mathematicia ; and thereupon I had altered it to this,\n'
  'De Motu Corporum Libri duo. But after second thought I re-\n'
  'tain the former title. It will help the sale of the book, which I\n'
  'ought not to diminish now \'tis yours."\n'
  '\n'
  'This " warning" arose from some pretensions put forth by Dr.\n'
  'Hooke. And though Newton gave a minute and positive refuta-\n'
  'tions of such claims, yet, to reconcile all differences, he gener-\n'
  'ously added to Prop. IV. Cor. 6, Book I., a Scholium, in which\n'
  'Wren, Hooke and Halley are acknowledged to have indepen-\n'
  'dently deduced the law of gravity from the second law of\n'
  'Kepler.\n'
  '\n'
  'The suppression of the third book Dr. Halley could not endure\n'
  'to see. "I must again beg you" says he, "not to let your re-\n'
  'sentments run so high as to deprive us of your third book, where-\n'
  'in your applications of your mathematical doctrine to the theory\n'
  'of comets, and several curious experiments, which, as I guess by\n'
  'what you write ought to compose it, will undoubtedly render it\n'
  'acceptable to those who will call themselves philosophers without\n'
  'mathematics, which are much the greater number." To these\n'
  'solicitations Newton yielded. There were no "resentments," how-\n'
  'ever, as we conceive, in his "design to suppress." He sought\n'
  'peace ; for he loved and valued it above all applause. But, in\n'
  "spite of his efforts for tranquillity's sake, his course of discovery\n"
  'was all along molested by ignorance or presumptuous rivalry.\n'
  '\n'
  'The publication of the great work now went rapidly forwards.\n'
  'The second book was sent to the Society, and presented on the\n'
  '2d March ; the third, on the 6th April ; and the whole was com-\n'
  'pleted and published in the month of May, 1686-7. In the sec-\n'
  'ond Lemma of the second book, the fundamental principle of his\n'
  'fluxionary calculus was, for the first time, given to the world ; but\n'
  'its algorithm or notation did not appear till published in the\n'
  "second volume of Dr. Wallis's works, in 1693.\n"
  '\n'
  'And thus was ushered into existence The PRINCIPIA-a work\n'
  'to which pre-eminence above all the productions of the human\n'
  'intellect has been awarded-a work that must be esteemed of\n'
  'priceless worth so long as Science has a votary, or a single wor-\n'

  'The entire work bears the general title of THE MATHEMATICAL\n'
  'PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. It consists of three books:\n'
  'the first two, entitled, OF THE MOTION OF BODIES, are occupied\n'
  'with the laws and conditions of motions and forces, and are illus-\n'
  'trated with many scholia treating of some of the most general\n'
  'and best established points in philosophy, such as the density and\n'
  'resistance of bodies, spaces void of matter, and the motion of\n'
  'sound and light. From these principles, there is deduced, in the\n'
  'third book, drawn up in as popular a style as possible and entitled,\n',
  'We are to\n'
  'conceive them as the just nascent principles of finite magnitudes. Nor do\n'

  'proportion, as nascent. It will be the same thing, if, instead of moments,\n'
  'we use either the velocities of the increments and decrements (which may\n'
  'also be called the motions, mutations, and fluxions of quantities), or any\n'
  'finite quantities proportional to those velocities. The co-efficient of '
  'any\n'
  'generating side is the quantity which arises by applying the genitum to\n'
  '.that side.\n'
  '\n'
  'Wherefore the sense of the Lemma is, that if the moments of any quan-\n'
  'tities A, B, C, &c., increasing or decreasing by a perpetual flux, or the\n'
  'velocities of the mutations which are proportional to them, be called a, '
  'b,\n'

  '¿aA - 5, gnA -3, -- aA -2,-2aA-3,-jaA-> respectively; and.\n'
  'in general, that the moment of any power A", will be " aA"-". Also,\n'
  'that the moment of the generated quantity A 2B will be 2aAB + bA2 ; the\n'
  'moment of the generated quantity A3B4C2 will be 3aA2B4C2 + 46A3\n'
  'B&C2 + 2cA3B&C; and the moment of the generated quantity B2 or\n'
  'A 3\n'
  'A3B-2 will be 3aA2B-2-2bA3B -- 3; and so on. The Lemma is\n'
  'thus demonstrated.\n'
  '\n'
  'CASE 1. Any rectangle, as AB, augmented by a perpetual flux, when, as\n'
  'yet, there wanted of the sides A and B half their moments ¿a and b, was\n'
  'A - ¿ a into B-1b, or AB - {a B-1b A + jab ; but as soon as the\n'
  'sides A and B are augmented by the other half moments, the rectangle be-\n'
  'comes A + ¿a into B + 16, or AB + Įa B +16 A +tab. From this\n'
  'rectangle subduct the former rectangle, and there will remain the exces?\n'
  '@B + bA. Therefore with the whole increments a and b of the sides, the\n'
  'increment aB + bA of the rectangle is generated. Q.E.D.\n'
  '\n'
  'CASE 2. Suppose AB always equal to G, and then the moment of the\n'
  'content ABC or GC (by Case 1) will be gC + cG, that is (putting AB and\n'
  'aB + bA for G and g), aBC + bAC + cAB. And the reasoning is the\n'
  'same for contents under ever so many sides. Q.E.D.\n'
  '\n'
  'CASE 3. Suppose the sides A, B, and C, to be always equal among them-\n'
  'selves; and the moment aB + bA, of A2, that is, of the rectangle AB,\n'
  'will be 2aA ; and the moment aBC + bAC + cAB of A3, that is, of the\n'
  'content ABC, will be 3aA2. And by the same reasoning the moment of\n'
  'any power A" is naAn-1. Q.E.D\n'

  'COR. 1. Hence in quantities continually proportional, if one term is\n'

 ['OF THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD, the constitution of the system of\n'

  'composed the third Book in a popular method, that it might be read\n'

  'ficently entered into the principles could not easily discover the\n'
  'strength of the consequences, nor lay aside the prejudices to which\n'
  'they had been many years accustomed, therefore, to prevent dis-\n'
  'putes which might be raised upon such accounts, I chose to reduce\n'
  'the substance of this Book into the form of Propositions (in the\n'
  'mathematical way), which should be read by those only who had\n'
  'first made themselves masters of the principles established in the\n'
  'preceding Books : not that I would advise any one to the previous\n'
  'study of every Proposition of those Books."-" It is enough it\n'
  'one carefully reads the Definitions, the Laws of Motion, and the\n'
  'three first Sections of the first Book. He may then pass on to\n'
  'this Book, and consult such of the remaining Propositions of the\n'
  'first two Books, as the references in this, and his occasions shall re-\n'

  "The principle of Universal Gravi' ation, namely, that every\n"
  'particle of matter is attracted by, or gravitates to, every other\n'
  'particle of matter, with a force inversely proportional to the\n'
  'squares of their distances-is the discovery which characterizes\n'
  'The PRINCIPIA. This principle the author deduced from the mo-\n'
  'tion of the moon, and the three laws of Kepler-laws, which\n'
  'Newton, in turn, by his greater law, demonstrated to be true.\n'
  '\n'
  'From the first law of Kepler, namely, the proportionality of\n'

  'the areas to the times of their description, our author inferred\n'
  'that the force which retained the planet in its orbit was always\n'
  'directed to the sun; and from the second, namely, that every\n'
  'planet moves in an ellipse with the sun in one of its foci, he drew\n'
  'the more general inference that the force by which the planet\n'
  'moves round that focus varies inversely as the square of its dis-\n'
  'tance therefrom : and he demonstrated that a planet acted upon\n'
  'by such a force could not move in any other curve than a conic\n'
  'section ; showing when the moving body would describe a circu-\n'
  'lar, an elliptical, a parabolic, or hyperbolic orbit. He demon-\n'
  'strated, too, that this force, or attracting, gravitating power re-\n'
  'sided in every, the least particle ; but that, in spherical masses, it\n'
  'operated as if confined to their centres; so that, one sphere or\n'
  'body will act upon another sphere or body, with a force directly\n'
  'proportional to the quantity of matter, and inversely as the square\n'
  'of the distance between their centres; and that their velocities of\n'
  'mutual approach will be in the inverse ratio of their quantities of\n'
  'matter. Thus he grandly outlined the Universal Law. Verify-\n'
  'ing its truth by the motions of terrestrial bodies, then by those of\n'
  'the moon and other secondary orbs, he finally embraced, in one\n'
  'mighty generalization, the entire Solar System-all the move-\n'
  'ments of all its bodies-planets, satellites and comets-explain-\n'
  'ing and harmonizing the many diverse and theretofore inexplica-\n'
  'ble phenomena.\n'
  '\n'
  'Guided by the genius of Newton, we see sphere bound to\n'
  'sphere, body to body, particle to particle, atom to mass, the min-\n'
  'utest part to the stupendous whole-each to each, each to all,\n'
  'and all to each-in the mysterious bonds of a ceaseless, recipro-\n'
  'cal influence. An influence whose workings are shown to be\n'
  'alike present in the globular dew-drop, or oblate-spheroidal earth ;\n'
  'in the falling shower, or vast heaving ocean tides; in the flying\n'
  'thistle-down, or fixed, ponderous rock ; in the swinging pendulum,\n'
  'or time-measuring sun ; in the varying and unequal moon, or\n'
  "earth's slowly retrograding poles ; in the uncertain meteor, or\n"
  'blazing comet wheeling swiftly away on its remote, yet determined\n'
  'round. An influence, in fine, that may link system to system\n'

  'move, in softest, swiftest measure, all the countless hosts that\n'
  "crowd heaven's fathomless deeps.\n"
  '\n'
  'And yet Newton, amid the loveliness and magnitude of Om-\n'
  'nipotence, lost not sight of the Almighty One. A secondary,\n'
  'however universal, was not taken for the First Cause. An im-\n'
  'pressed force, however diffused and powerful, assumed not the\n'
  'functions of the creating, giving Energy. Material beauties,\n'
  'splendours, and sublimities, however rich in glory, and endless in\n'
  'extent, concealed not the attributes of an intelligent Supreme.\n'
  'From the depths of his own soul, through reason and the WORD,\n'
  'he had risen, à priori, to God : from the heights of Omnipotence,\n'
  'through the design and law of the builded universe, he proved à\n'
  'posteriori, a Deity. " I had," says he, “ an eye upon such prin-\n'
  'ciples as might work, with considering men, for the belief of a\n'
  'Deity," in writing the PRINCIPIA ; at the conclusion whereof, he\n'
  'teaches that-" this most beautiful system of the sun, planets and\n'
  'comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an\n'
  'intelligent and powerful Being. And if the fixed stars are the\n'
  'centres of other like systems, these, being forme l by the like\n'
  'wise counsels, must be all subject to the dominion of One; especially\n'
  'since the light of the fixed stars is of the same nature with the\n'
  'light of the sun, and from every system light passes into all other\n'
  'systems : and lest the systems of the fixed stars should, by their\n'
  'gravity, fall on each other mutually, he hath placed those systems\n'
  'at immense distances one from another.\n'

  'miles, or rather as many semi-diameters of the earth, those bodies, '

  '\n'
  'As when a stone is projected obliquely, that is, any way but in the per-\n'
  'pendicular direction, the perpetual deflection thereof towards the earth\n'
  'from the right line in which it was projected is a proof of its '
  'gravitation\n'
  'to the earth, no less certain than its direct descent when only suffered '
  'to\n'
  'fall freely from rest; so the deviation of bodies moving in free spaces '
  'from\n'
  'rectilinear paths, and perpetual deflection therefrom towards any place, '
  'is\n'
  'a sure indication of the existence of some force which from all quarters\n'
  'impels those bodies towards that place.\n'
  '\n'
  'And as, from the supposed existence of gravity, it necessarily follows\n'
  'that all bodies about the earth must press downwards, and therefore must\n'
  'either descend directly to the earth, if they are let fall from rest, or '
  'at\n'
  'least perpetually deviate from right lines towards the earth, if they are\n'
  'projected obliquely ; so from the supposed existence of a force directed '
  'to\n'
  'any centre, it will follow, by the like necessity, that all bodies upon '
  'which\n'
  'this force acts must either descend directly to that centre, or at least '
  'devi-\n'
  'ate perpetually towards it from right lines, if otherwise they should have\n'
  'moved obliquely in these right lines.\n'
  '\n'
  'And how from the motions given we may infer the forces, or from the\n'
  'forces given we may determine the motions, is shewn in the two first Books\n'
  'of our Principles of Philosophy.\n'
  '\n'
  'If the earth is supposed to stand still, and the fixed stars to be '
  'revolved\n'
  'in free spaces in the space of 24 hours, it is certain the forces by which\n'
  'the fixed stars are retained in their orbs are not directed to the earth, '
  'but\n'
  'to the centres of the several orbs, that is, of the several parallel '
  'circles.\n'
  'which the fixed stars, declining to one side and the other from the '
  'equator,\n'
  'describe daily ; also that by radii drawn to the centres of those orbs the\n'
  'fixed stars describe areas exactly proportional to the times of '
  'description.\n'
  'Then, because the periodic times are equal (by Cor. III, Prop. IV, Book '
  '1),\n'
  'it follows that the centripetal forces are as the radii of the several '
  'orbs,\n'
  'and that they will perpetually revolve in the same orbs. And the like\n'
  'consequences may be drawn from the supposed diurnal motion of the\n'
  'planets.\n'
  '\n'
  'That forces should be directed to no body on which they physically de-\n'
  'pend, but to innumerable imaginary points in the axis of the earth, is an\n'
  'hypothesis too incongruous. It is more incongruous still that those forces\n'
  'should increase exactly in proportion of the distances from this axis ; '

  '\n'
  'this is an indi ation of an increase to immensity, or rather to infinity ;\n'
  'whereas the forces of natural things commonly decrease in receding from\n'
  'the fountain from which they flow. But, what is yet more absurd, neither\n'
  'are the areas described by the same star proportional to the times, nor '
  'are\n'
  'its revolutions performed in the same orb ; for as the star recedes from '
  'the\n'
  'neighbouring pole, both areas and orb increase; and from the increase of\n'
  'the area it is demonstrated that the forces are not directed to the axis '
  'of\n'
  'the earth. And this difficulty (Cor. 1, Prop. II) arises from the twofold\n'
  'motion that is observed in the fixed stars, one diurnal round the axis of\n'
  'the earth, the other exceedingly slow round the axis of the ecliptic. And\n'
  'the explication thereof requires a composition of forces so perplexed and\n'
  'so variable, that it is hardly to be reconciled with any physical theory.\n'

  'This problem is solved arithmetically by reducing the orbit, which a\n'

  'tripetal force is to be reduced to a fraction whose denominator is A3, and\n'
  'the numerators are to be made analogous by collating together the homo-\n'

  '\n'
  'EXAMPLE 1. Let us suppose the centripetal force to be uniform,\n'

  'Now since the orbit is supposed extremely near to a circle, let it '

  'I have exhibited in this Proposition the resistance and retardation of\n'

  'of\n'
  'the medium be perfectly elastic, and are endued with the utmost force of\n'
  'reflexion; and that this force, where the globe and particles of the '
  'medium\n'
  'are infinitely hard and void of any reflecting force, is diminished one '
  'half.\n'
  'But in continued mediums, as water, hot oil, and quicksilver, the globe as\n'
  'it passes through them does not immediately strike against all the parti-\n'

  'lie nearest, and by that impulse compress and condense them ; and in re-\n'
  'turning suffer those compressed parts to recede again, and expand them-\n'
  'selves. Therefore the parts of the medium that lie nearest to the '
  'tremulous\n'
  'body move to and fro by turns, in like manner as the parts of the '
  'tremulous\n'
  'body itself do; and for the same cause that the parts of this body agitate\n'
  'these parts of the medium, these parts, being agitated by like tremors, '
  'will\n'
  'in their turn agitate others next to themselves; and these others, '
  'agitated\n'
  'in like manner, will agitate those that lie beyond them, and so on in '
  'infin-\n'
  'itum. And in the same manner as the first parts of the medium were\n'
  'condensed in going, and relaxed in returning, so will the other parts be\n'
  'condensed every time they go, and expand themselves every time they re-\n'
  'turn. And therefore they will not be all going and all returning at the\n'
  'same instant (for in that case they would always preserve determined dis-\n'
  'tances from each other, and there could be no alternate condensation and\n'
  'rarefaction); but since, in the places where they are condensed, they ap-\n'
  'proach to, and, in the places where they are rarefied, recede from each '
  'other,\n'
  'therefore some of them will be going while others are returning ; and so '
  'on\n'
  'in infinitum. The parts so going, and in their going condensed, are '
  'pulses,\n'
  'by reason of the progressive motion with which they strike obstacles in\n'
  'their way; and therefore the successive pulses produced by a tremulous\n'
  'body will be propagated in rectilinear directions; and that at nearly '
  'equal\n'
  'distances from each other, because of the equal intervals of time in which\n'
  'the body, by its several tremors produces the several pulses. And though\n'
  'the parts of the tremulous body go and return .n some certain and deter-\n'
  'minate direction, yet the pulses propagated from thence through the medium\n'
  'will dilate themselves towards the sides, by the foregoing Proposition ; '

  '\n'
  'Case 2. If the medium be not elastic, then, because its parts cannot be\n'
  'condensed by the pressure arising from the vibrating parts of the '

  'body, the motion will be propagated in an instant towards the parts where\n'
  'the medium yields most easily, that is, to the parts which the tremulous\n'
  'body would otherwise leave vacuous behind it. The case is the same with\n'
  'that of a body projected in any medium whatever. A medium yielding\n'
  'to projectiles does not recede in infinitum, but with a circular motion '
  'comes\n'
  'round to the spaces which the body leaves behind it. Therefore as often\n'
  'as a tremulous body tends to any part, the medium yielding to it comes\n'
  'round in a circle to the parts which the body leaves ; and as often as the\n'
  'body returns to the first place, the medium will be driven from the place '
  'it\n'
  'came round to, and return to its original place. And though the tremulous\n'
  'body be not firm and hard, but every way flexible, yet if it continue of a\n'
  'given magnitude, since it cannot impel the medium by its tremors any\n'
  'where without yielding to it somewhere else, the medium receding from the\n'
  'parts of the body where it is pressed will always come round in a circle '
  'to\n'
  'the parts that yield to it. Q.E.D.\n'

  'agitation of the parts of flame conduces to the propagation of a pressure '
  'in\n'

  'the pendulum describes, P its lowest point, PQ an arc equal to the neight\n'
  'AE. The force with which the motion of the water is accelerated and re-\n'
  'tarded alternately is the excess of the weight of the water in one leg '
  'above\n'
  'the weight in the other; and, therefore, when the water in the leg KL\n'
  'ascends to EF, and in the other leg descends to GH, that force is double\n'
  'the weight of the water EABF, and therefore is to the weight of the whole\n'

  'much the longer, and therefore to have returned to those marks at the end\n'
  'of 78 oscillations. But it returned to them at the end of 77 oscillations.\n'
  '\n'
  'Let, therefore, A represent the resistance of the box upon its external\n'
  'superficies, and B the resistance of the empty box on its internal '
  'superficies ;\n'
  'and if the resistances to the internal parts of bodies equally swift be as '
  'the\n'
  'matter, or the number of particles that are resisted, then 7SB will be the\n'
  'resistance made to the internal parts of the box, when full; and therefore\n'
  'the whole resistance A + B of the empty box will be to the whole resist-\n'
  'ance A + 78B of the full box as 77 to 78, and, by division, A + B to 77B\n'
  'as 77 to 1; and thence A + B to B as 77 × 77 to 1, and, by division\n'

  'its internal parts will be above 5000 times less than the resistance on '

  'The first time I made it, the hook being weak, the full box was retarded\n'
  'sooner. The cause I found to be, that the hook was not strong enough to\n'
  'bear the weight of the box; so that, as it oscillated to and fro, the hook\n'
  'was bent sometimes this and sometimes that way. I therefore procured a\n'
  'hook of sufficient strength, so that the point of suspension might remain\n'
  'unmoved, and then all things happened as is above described.\n'

  'Suppose two similar systemis of bodies consisting of un equal number of\n'
  'particles, and let the correspondent particles be similar and propor-\n'
  'tional, each in one system to each in the other, and have a like situa-\n'
  'tion among themselves, and the same given ratio of density to euch\n'
  'other ; and let them begin to move among themselves in proportional\n'
  'times, and with like motions (that is, those in one system among one\n'
  'another, and those in the other among one another). And if the par-\n'
  'ticles that are in the same system do not touch one another, except ir\n'
  'the moments of reflexion ; nor attract, nor repel each other, except with\n'
  'accelerative forces that are as the diameters of the correspondent parti-\n'
  'cles inversely, and the squares of the velocities directly ; I say, that '
  'the\n'
  'particles of those systems will continue to move among themselves with\n'
  'like motions and in proportional times.\n'
  '\n'
  'Like bodies in like situations are said to be moved among themselves\n'
  'with like motions and in proportional times, when their situations at the\n'
  'end of those times are always found alike in respect of each other .; '
  'as-sup-\n'
  'pose we compare the particles in one system with the correspondent parti-\n'
  'cles in the other. Hence the times will be proportional, in which similar\n'
  'and proportional parts of similar figures will be described by '
  'correspondent\n'
  'particles. Therefore if we suppose two systems of this kind, the corre-\n'
  'spondent particles, by reason of the similitude of the motions at their\n'
  'beginning, will continue to be moved with like motions, so long as they\n'
  'move without meeting one another ; for if they are acted on by no forces,\n'
  'they will go on uniformly in right lines, by the 1st Law. But if they do\n'
  'agitate one another with some certain forces, and those forces are as the\n'
  'diameters of the correspondent particles inversely and the squares of the\n'
  'velocities directly, then, because the particles are in like situations, '
  'and\n'
  'their forces are proportional, the whole forces with which correspondent\n'
  'particles are agitated, and which are compounded of each of the agitating\n'
  'forces (by Corol. 2 of the Laws), will have like directions, and have the\n'
  'same effect as if they respected centres placed alike among the particles '
  ';\n'
  'and those whole forces will be to each other as the several forces which\n'

  'correspondent particles to continue to describe like figures. These things\n'
  'will be so (by Cor. 1 and S, Prop. IV., Book 1), if those centres are at '
  'rest\n'
  'but if they are moved, yet by reason of the similitude of the '
  'translations,\n'
  'their situations among the particles of the system will remain similar, so\n'
  'that the changes introduced into the figures described by the particles '
  'will\n'
  'still be similar. So that the motions of correspondent and similar par-\n'
  'ticles will continue similar till their first meeting with each other; and\n'
  'thence will arise similar collisions, and similar reflexions ; which will '
  'again\n'
  'beget similar motions of the particles among themselves (by what was just\n'
  'now shown), till they mutually fall upon one another again, and so on ad\n'
  'infinitum.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 1. Hence if any two bodies, which are similar and in like situations\n'

  'in like manner and in proportional times, and their magnitudes and densi-\n'

  'proportional times ; for the case of the greater parts of both systems and '
  'of\n'
  'the particles is the very same.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 2. And if all the similar and similarly situated parts of both sys-\n'
  'tems be at rest among themselves ; and two of them, which are greater than\n'
  'the rest, and mutually correspondent in both systems, begin to move in\n'
  'lines alike posited, with any similar motion whatsoever, they will excite\n'
  'similar motions in the rest of the parts of the systems, and will continue\n'

  '## PROPOSITION XXXIII. THEOREM XXVII.\n'
  '\n'
  'The same things being supposed, I say, that the greater parts of the\n'
  'systems are resisted in a ratio compounded of the duplicate ratio of\n'
  'their velocities, and the duplicate ratio of their diameters, and the sim-\n'
  'ple ratio of the density of the parts of the systems.\n'
  '\n'
  'For the resistance arises partly from the centripetal or centrifugal '
  'forces\n'
  'with which the particles of the system mutually act on each other, partly\n'
  'from the collisions and reflexions of the particles and the greater parts.\n'
  'The resistances of the first kind are to each other as the whole motive\n'
  'forces from which they arise, that is, as the whole accelerative forces '

  'position), as the squares of the velocities directly, and the distances of '
  'the\n'
  'corresponding particles inversely, and the quantities of matter in the '
  'cor-\n'
  'respondent parts directly : and therefore since the distances of the '

  'the\n'

  '\n'
  '<!-- PageHeader="OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY." -->\n'
  '\n'
  'diameter of the correspondent particle or part in the other, and since the\n'
  'quantities of matter are as the densities of the parts and the cubes of '
  'the\n'
  'diameters ; the resistances are to each other as the squares of the '
  'velocities\n'
  'and the squares of the diameters and the densities of the parts of the '
  'sys-\n'
  'tems. Q.E.D. The resistances of the latter sort are as the number of\n'
  'correspondent reflexions and the forces of those reflexions conjunctly ; '
  'but\n'
  'the number of the reflexions are to each other as the velocities of the cor '
  '-\n'
  'responding parts directly and the spaces between their reflexions '
  'inversely.\n'
  'And the forces of the reflexions are as the velocities and the magnitudes\n'
  'and the densities of the corresponding parts conjunctly ; that is, as the '
  've-\n'
  'locities and the cubes of the diameters and the densities of the parts. '
  'And,\n'
  'joining all these ratios, the resistances of the corresponding parts are '
  'to\n'
  'each other as the squares of the velocities and the squares of the '
  'diameters\n'
  'and the densities of the parts conjunctly. Q.E.D.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 1. Therefore if those systems are two elastic fluids, like our air,\n'
  'and their parts are at rest among themselves ; and two similar bodies pro-\n'
  'portional in magnitude and density to the parts of the fluids, and '
  'similarly\n'

  'similarly posited ; and the accelerative forces with which the particles '
  'of\n'
  'the fluids mutually act upon each other are as the diameters of the bodies\n'
  'projected inversely and the squares of their velocities directly ; those '
  'bodies\n'
  'will excite similar motions in the fluids in proportional times, and will '
  'de-\n'
  'scribe similar spaces and proportional to their diameters.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 2. Therefore in the same fluid a projected body that moves swiftly\n'
  'meets with a resistance that is, in the duplicate ratio of its velocity, '
  'nearly.\n'
  'For if the forces with which distant particles act mutually upon one\n'
  'another should be augmented in the duplicate ratio of the velocity, the\n'
  'projected body would be resisted in the same duplicate ratio accurately ;\n'
  'and therefore in a medium, whose parts when at a distance do not act mu-\n'
  'tually with any force on one another, the resistance is in the duplicate '
  'ra-\n'
  'tio of the velocity accurately. Let there be, therefore, three mediums A,\n'
  'B, C, consisting of similar and equal parts regularly disposed at equal\n'
  'distances. Let the parts of the mediums A and B recede from each other\n'
  'with forces that are among themselves as T and V; and let the parts of\n'
  'the medium C be entirely destitute of any such forces. And if four equal\n'
  'bodies D, E, F, G, move in these mediums, the two first D and E in the\n'
  'two first A and B, and the other two F and G in the third C; and if the\n'

  'and F be equally swift, as also the bodies E and G; and, augmenting the\n'
  'velocities of the bodies D and F in any ratio, and diminishing the forces\n'
  'of the particles of the medium B in the duplicate of the same ratio, the\n'
  'medium B will approach to the form and condition of the medium C at\n'
  'pleasure; and therefore the resistances of the equal and equally swift\n'
  'bodies E and G ir. these mediums will perpetually approach to equality\n'
  'so that their difference will at last become less than any given. There-\n'
  'fore since the resistances of the bodies D and F are to each other as the\n'
  'resistances of the bodies E and G, those will also in like manner approach\n'
  'to the ratio of equality. Therefore the bodies D and F, when they move\n'
  'with very great swiftness, meet with resistances very nearly equal; and\n'
  'therefore since the resistance of the body F is in a duplicate ratio of '
  'the\n'
  'velocity, the resistance of the body D will be nearly in the same ratio.\n'

  'COR. 3. The resistance of a body moving very swift in an elastic fluid\n'
  'is almost the same as if the parts of the fluid were destitute of their '
  'cen-\n'
  'trifugal forces, and did not fly from each other; if so be that the '
  'elasti-\n'
  'city of the fluid arise from the centrifugal forces of the particles, and '
  'the\n'
  'velocity be so great as not to allow the particles time enough to act.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 4. Therefore, since the resistances of similar and equally swift\n'
  'bodies, in a medium whose distant parts do not fly from each other, are as\n'
  'the squares of the diameters, the resistances made to bodies moving with\n'
  'very great and equal velocities in an elastic fluid will be as the squares '
  'of\n'
  'the diameters, nearly.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 5. And since similar, equal, and equally swift bodies, moving\n'
  'through mediums of the same density, whose particles do not fly from each\n'
  'other mutually, will strike against an equal quantity of matter in equal\n'
  'times, whether the particles of which the medium consists be more and\n'
  'smaller, or fewer and greater, and therefore impress on that matter an '
  'equal\n'
  'quantity of motion, and in return (by the 3d Law of Motion) suffer an\n'
  'equal re-action from the same, that is, are equally resisted ; it is '
  'manifest,\n'
  'also, that in elastic fluids of the same density, when the bodies move '
  'with\n'
  'extreme swiftness, their resistances are nearly equal, whether the fluids\n'
  'consist of gross parts, or of parts ever so subtile. For the resistance of\n'
  'projectiles moving with exceedingly great celerities is not much '
  'diminished\n'
  'by the subtilty of the medium.\n'
  '\n'
  'COR. 6. All these things are so in fluids whose elastic force takes its '
  'rise\n'
  'from the centrifugal forces of the particles. But if that force arise from\n'
  'some other cause, as from the expansion of the particles after the manner\n'
  'of wool, or the boughs of trees, or any other cause, by which the '
  'particles\n'
  'are hindered from moving freely among themselves, the resistance, by\n'
  'reason of the lesser fluidity of the medium, will be greater than in the\n'
  'Corollaries above.\n'

  '## PROPOSITION XXXIV. THEOREM XXVIII.\n'
  '\n'
  'If in a rare medium, consisting of equal particles freely disposed at\n'
  'equal distances from each other, a globe and a cylinder described on\n'],
 ['\n'
  'A property, near akin to the preceding, is this, that if a place is moved,\n'
  'whatever is placed therein moves along with it; and therefore a body,\n'
  'which is moved from a place in motion, partakes also of the motion of its\n'
  'place. Upon which account, all motions, from places in motion, are no\n'
  'other than parts of entire and absolute motions; and every entire motion\n'
  'is composed of the motion of the body out of its first place, and the\n'
  'motion of this place out of its place ; and so on, until we come to some\n'
  'immovable place, as in the before-mentioned example of the sailor. Where-\n'
  'fore, entire and absolute motions can be no otherwise determined than by\n'
  'immovable places; and for that reason I did before refer those absolute\n'
  'motions to immovable places, but relative ones to movable places. Now\n'
  'no other places are immovable but those that, from infinity to infinity, '
  'do\n'
  'all retain the same given position one to another ; and upon this account\n'
  'must ever remain unmoved ; and do thereby constitute immovable space.\n'
  '\n'
  'The causes by which true and relative motions are distinguished, one\n'
  'from the other, are the forces impressed upon bodies to generate motion.\n'
  "'True motion is neither gencrated nor altered, but by some force impressed\n"
  'upon the body moved; but relative motion may be generated or altered\n'
  'without any force impressed upon the body. For it is sufficient only to\n'
  'impress some force on other bodies with which the former is compared,\n'
  'that by their giving way, that relation may be changed, in which the re-\n'
  'lative rest or motion of this other body did consist. Again, true motion\n'
  'suffers always some change from any force impressed upon the moving\n'
  'body ; but relative motion does not necessarily undergo any change by such\n'
  'forces. For if the same forces are likewise impressed on those other '
  'bodies,\n'
  'with which the comparison is made, that the relative position may be pre-\n'
  'served, then that condition will be preserved in which the relative motion\n'
  'consists. And therefore any relative motion may be changed when the\n'
  'true motion remains unaltered, and the relative may be preserved when the\n'
  'true suffers some change. Upon which accounts, true motion does by no\n'
  'means consist in such relations.\n'
  '\n'
  'The effects which distinguish absolute from relative motion are, the\n'
  'forces of receding from the axis of circular motion. For there are no such\n'
  'forces in a circular motion purely relative, but in a true and absolute '
  'cir-\n'
  'cular motion, they are greater or less, according to the quantity of the\n'

  '\n'
  'motion. If a vessel, hung by a long cord, is so often turned about that '
  'the\n'
  'cord is strongly twisted, then filled with water, and held at rest '
  'together\n'
  'with the water; after, by the sudden action of another force, it is '
  'whirled\n'
  'about the contrary way, and while the cord is untwisting itself, the '
  'vessel\n'
  'continues for some time in this motion ; the surface of the water will at\n'
  'first be plain, as before the vessel began to move; but the vessel, by '
  'grad-\n'
  'ually communicating its motion to the water, will make it begin sensibly\n'
  'to revolve, and recede by little and little from the middle, and ascend to '
  'the\n'
  'sides of the vessel, forming itself into a concave figure (as I have '
  'experi-\n'
  'enced), and the swifter the motion becomes, the higher will the water '
  'rise,\n'
  'till at last, performing its revolutions in the same times with the '
  'vessel,\n'
  'it becomes relatively at rest in it. This ascent of the water shows its '
  'en-\n'
  'deavour to recede from the axis of its motion; and the true and absolute\n'
  'circular motion of the water, which is here directly contrary to the rela-\n'
  'tive, discovers itself, and may be measured by this endeavour. At first,\n'
  'when the relative motion of the water in the vessel was greatest, it pro-\n'
  'duced no endeavour to recede from the axis ; the water showed no tendency\n'
  'to the circumference, nor any ascent towards the sides of the vessel, but\n'
  'remained of a plain surface, and therefore its true circular motion had '
  'not\n'
  'yet begun. But afterwards, when the relative motion of the water had\n'
  'decreased, the ascent thereof towards the sides of the vessel proved its '
  'en-\n'
  'deavour to recede from the axis; and this endeavour showed the real cir-\n'
  'cular motion of the water perpetually increasing, till it had acquired its\n'
  'greatest quantity, when the water rested relatively in the vessel. And\n'
  'therefore this endeavour does not depend upon any translation of the water\n'
  'in respect of the ambient bodies, nor can true circular motion be defined\n'
  'by such translation. There is only one real circular motion of any one\n'
  'revolving body, corresponding to only one power of endeavouring to recede\n'
  'from its axis of motion, as its proper and adequate effect ; but relative\n'
  'motions, in one and the same body, are innumerable, according to the '
  'various\n'
  'relations it bears to external bodies, and like other relations, are '
  'altogether\n'
  'destitute of any real effect, any otherwise than they may perhaps par-\n'
  'take of that one only true motion. And therefore in their system who\n'
  'suppose that our heavens, revolving below the sphere of the fixed stars,\n'
  'carry the planets along with them ; the several parts of those heavens, '
  'and\n'
  'the planets, which are indeed relatively at rest in their heavens, do yet\n'
  'really move. For they change their position one to another (which never\n'
  'happens to bodies truly at rest), and being carried together with their\n'
  'heavens, partake of their motions, and as parts of revolving wholes,\n'
  'endeavour to recede from the axis of their motions.\n'
  '\n'
  'Wherefore relative quantities are not the quantities themselves, whose\n'
  'names they bear, but those sensible measures of them (either accurate er\n'
  'inaccurate), which are commonly used instead of the measured quantities\n'
  'themselves. And if the meaning of words is to be determined by their\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageBreak -->\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageNumber="82" -->\n'
  '<!-- PageHeader="THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES" -->\n'
  '\n'
  'use, then by the names time, space, place and motion, their measures arv\n'
  'properly to be understood; and the expression will be unusual, and purely\n'
  'mathematical, if the measured quantities themselves are meant. Upon\n'
  'which account, they do strain the sacred writings, who there interpret\n'
  'those words for the measured quantities. Nor do those less defile the\n'
  'purity of mathematical and philosophical truths, who confound real quan-\n'
  'tities themselves with their relations and vulgar measures.\n'
  '\n'
  'It is indeed a matter of great difficulty to discover, and effectually to\n'
  'distinguish, the true motions of particular bodies from the apparent; be-\n'
  'cause the parts of that immovable space, in which those motions are per-\n'
  'formed, do by no means come under the observation of our senses. Yet\n'
  'the thing is not altogether desperate; for we have some arguments to\n'
  'guide us, partly from the apparent motions, which are the differences of\n'
  'the true motions; partly from the forces, which are the causes and effects\n'
  'of the true motions. For instance, if two globes, kept at a given distance\n'
  'one from the other by means of a cord that connects them, were revolved\n'
  'about their common centre of gravity, we might, from the tension of the\n'
  'cord, discover the endeavour of the globes to recede from the axis of '
  'their\n'
  'motion, and from thence we might compute the quantity of their circular\n'
  'motions. And then if any equal forces should be impressed at once on the\n'
  'alternate faces of the globes to augment or diminish their circular '
  'motions,\n'
  'from the increase or decr ase of the tension of the cord, we might infer\n'
  'the increment or decrement of their motions; and thence would be found\n'
  'on what faces those forces ought to be impressed, that the motions of the\n',
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageNumber="TS" -->\n'
  '<!-- PageHeader="THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES" -->\n'
  '\n'
  'the air passes ; at another time it will be another part of the same, and '
  'so,\n'
  'absolutely understood, it will be perpetually mutable.\n'
  '\n'
  'III. Place is a part of space which a body takes up, and is according to\n'
  'the space, either absolute or relative. I say, a part of space; not the '
  'situation,\n'
  'nor the external surface of the body. For the places of equal solids are\n'
  'always equal; but their superfices, by reason of their dissimilar figures, '
  'are\n'
  'often unequal. Positions properly have no quantity, nor are they so much\n'
  'the places themselves, as the properties of places. The motion of the '
  'whole\n'
  'is the same thing with the sum of the motions of the parts; that is, the\n'
  'translation of the whole, out of its place, is the same thing with the sum\n'
  'of the translations of the parts out of their places; and therefore the '
  'place\n'
  'of the whole is the same thing with the sum of the places of the parts, '
  'and\n'
  'for that reason, it is internal, and in the whole body.\n'
  '\n'
  'IV. Absolute motion is the translation of a body from one absolute\n'
  'place into another; and relative motion, the translation from one relative\n'
  'place into another. Thus in a ship under sail, the relative place of a '
  'body\n'
  'is that part of the ship which the body possesses; or that part of its '
  'cavity\n'
  'which the body fills, and which therefore moves together with the ship:\n'
  'and relative rest is the continuance of the body in the same part of the\n'
  'ship, or of its cavity. But real, absolute rest, is the continuance of the\n'
  'body in the same part of that immovable space, in which the ship itself,\n'
  'its cavity, and all that it contains, is moved. Wherefore, if the earth is\n'
  'really at rest, the body, which relatively rests in the ship, will really '
  'and\n'
  'absolutely move with the same velocity which the ship has on the earth.\n'
  'But if the earth also moves, the true and absolute motion of the body will\n'
  'arise, partly from the true motion of the earth, in immovable space ; '
  'partly\n'
  'from the relative motion of the ship on the earth; and if the body moves\n'
  'also relatively in the ship; its true motion will arise, partly from the '
  'true\n'
  'motion of the earth, in immovable space, and partly from the relative mo-\n'
  'tions as well of the ship on the earth, as of the body in the ship ; and '
  'from\n'
  'these relative motions will arise the relative motion of the body on the\n'
  'earth. As if that part of the earth, where the ship is, was truly moved\n'
  'toward the east, with a velocity of 10010 parts; while the ship itself, '
  'with\n'
  'a fresh gale, and full sails, is carried towards the west, with a velocity '
  'ex-\n'
  'pressed by 10 of those parts ; but a sailor walks in the ship towards the\n'
  'east, with 1 part of the said velocity ; then the sailor will be moved '
  'truly\n'
  'in immovable space towards the east, with a velocity of 10001 parts, and\n'
  'relatively on the earth towards the west, with a velocity of 9 of those '
  'parts.\n'
  '\n'
  'Absolute time, in astronomy, is distinguished from relative, by the equa-\n'
  'tion or correction of the vulgar time. For the natural days are truly un-\n'
  'equal, though they are commonly considered as equal, and used for a meas-\n'
  'ure of time; astronomers correct this inequality for their more accurate\n'
  'deducing of the celestial motions. It may be, that there is no such thing\n'
  'as an equable motion, whereby time may be accurately measured. All mo\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageBreak -->\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageNumber="79" -->\n'
  '<!-- PageHeader="OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY." -->\n'
  '\n'
  'tions may be accelerated and retarded, but the true, or equable, progress '
  'of\n'
  'absolute time is liable to no change. The duration or perseverance of the\n'
  'existence of things remains the same, whether the motions are swift or '
  'slow,\n'
  'or none at all : and therefore it ought to be distinguished from what are\n'
  'only sensible measures thereof; and out of which we collect it, by means\n'
  'of the astronomical equation. The necessity of which equation, for deter-\n'
  'mining the times of a phenomenon, is evinced as well from the experiments\n'
  'of the pendulum clock, as by eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter.\n'
  '\n'
  'As the order of the parts of time is immutable, so also is the order of\n'
  'the parts of space. Suppose those parts to be moved out of their places, '
  'and\n'
  'they will be moved (if the expression may be allowed) out of themselves.\n'
  'For times and spaces are, as it were, the places as well of themselves as '
  'of\n'
  'all other things. All things are placed in time as to order of succession '
  ';\n'
  'and in space as to order of situation. It is from their essence or nature\n'
  'that they are places; and that the primary places of things should be\n'
  'moveable, is absurd. These are therefore the absolute places; and trans-\n'
  'lations out of those places, are the only absolute motions.\n'
  '\n'
  'But because the parts of space cannot be seen, or distinguished from one\n'
  'another by our senses, therefore in their stead we use sensible measures '
  'of\n'
  'them. For from the positions and distances of things from any body con-\n'
  'sidered as immovable, we define all places; and then with respect to such\n'
  'places, we estimate all motions, considering bodies as transferred from '
  'some\n'
  "of those places into others. And'so, instead of absolute places and "
  'motions,\n'
  'we use relative ones; and that without any inconvenience in common af-\n'
  'ťairs; but in philosophical disquisitions, we ought to abstract from our\n'
  'senses, and consider things themselves, distinct from what are only '
  'sensible\n'
  'measures of them. For it may be that there is no body really at rest, to\n'
  'which the places and motions of others may be referred.\n'
  '\n'
  'But we may distinguish rest and motion, absolute and relative, one from\n'
  'the other by their properties, causes and effects. It is a property of '
  'rest,\n'
  'that bodies really at rest do rest in respect to one another. And '
  'therefore\n'
  'as it is possible, that in the remote regions of the fixed stars, or '
  'perhaps\n'
  'far beyond them, there may be some body absolutely at rest; but impossi-\n'
  'ble to know, from the position of bodies to one another in our regions\n'
  'whether any of these do keep the same position to that remote body ; it\n'
  'follows that absolute rest cannot be determined from the position of '
  'bodies\n'
  'in our regions.\n'
  '\n'
  'It is a property of motion, that the parts, which retain given positions\n'
  'to their wholes, do partake of the motions of those wholes. For all the\n'
  'parts of revolving bodies endeavour to recede from the axis of motion ;\n'
  'and the impetus of bodies moving forward, arises from the joint impetus\n'
  'of all the parts. Therefore, if surrounding bodies are moved, those that\n'
  'are relatively at rest within them, will partake of their motion. Upon\n'
  'which account, the true and absolute motion of a body cannot be deter-\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageBreak -->\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageNumber="80" -->\n'
  '<!-- PageHeader="THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES" -->\n'
  '\n'
  'mined by the translation of it from those which only seem to rest ; for '
  'the\n'
  'external bodies ought not only to appear at rest, but to be really at '
  'rest.\n'
  'For otherwise, all included bodies, beside their translation from near the\n'
  'surrounding ones, partake likewise of their true motions; and though that\n'
  'translation were not made they would not be really at rest, but only seem\n'
  'to be so. For the surrounding bodies stand in the like relation to the\n'
  'surrounded as the exterior part of a whole does to the interior, or as the\n'
  'shell does to the kernel; but, if the shell moves, the kernel will also\n'
  'move, as being part of the whole, without any removal from near the '
  'shell.\n',

  'ADt will be as the sum of the particles of time answering to each of the\n'
  'lost particles pq of the decreasing velocity Ap, till that velocity, being '

  'the sector DAV, and of the triangle DAQ; and these particles will be to\n'
  'each other as DT2 to DP2, that is (if TX and AP are parallel), as DX 2\n'
  'to DA2 or TX2 to AP2 ; and, by division, as DX2 - TX2 to DA? --\n'
  'AP2. But, from the nature of the hyperbola, DX 2 -- TX 2 is AD? ; and, by\n'
  'the supposition, AP2 is AD X AK. Therefore the particles are to each\n'

  'to CK : and therefore the particle TDV of the sector is\n'
  'PDQ × AC\n'

  'therefore (because AC and AD are given) as CR; that is, as the increment\n',
  'is endued with gravity, or by any other force, that impels it towards the\n'

  'linear way, which by its innate force it would pursue; and would be made\n'
  'to revolve in the orbit which it now describes ; nor could the moon with-\n'
  'out some such force, be retained in its orbit. If this force was too '
  'small,\n'
  'it would not sufficiently turn the moon out of a rectilinear course: if it\n'
  'was too great, it would turn it too much, and draw down the moon from\n'
  'its orbit towards the earth. It is necessary, that the force be of a just\n'
  'quantity, and it belongs to the mathematicians to find the force, that may\n'
  'serve exactly to retain a body in a given orbit, with a given velocity ; '
  'and\n'
  'vice versa, to determine the curvilinear way, into which a body projected\n'

  '### DEFINITION VI.\n'
  '\n'
  'The absolute quantity of a centripetal force is the measure of the same\n'
  'proportional to the efficacy of the cause that propagates it from the cen-\n'

  '\n'
  '### DEFINITION VII.\n'
  '\n'
  'The accelerative quantity of a centripetal force is the measure of the\n'
  'same, proportional to the velocity which it generates in a given time.\n'
  '\n'
  'Thus the force of the same load-stone is greater at a less distance, and\n'
  'less at a greater : also the force of gravity is greater in valleys, less '
  'on\n'
  'tops of exceeding high mountains ; and yet less (as shall hereafter be '
  'shown),\n'
  'at greater distances from the body of the earth; but at equal distan-\n'
  'ces, it is the same everywhere; because (taking away, or allowing for, the\n'
  'resistance of the air), it equally accelerates all falling bodies, whether '
  'heavy\n'
  'or light, great or small.\n'
  '\n'
  '\n'
  '### DEFINITION VIII.\n'
  '\n'
  'The motive quantity of a centripetal force, is the measure of the same;\n'
  'proportional to the motion which it generates in a given time.\n'
  '\n'
  'Thus the weight is greater in a greater body, less in a less body ; and,\n'
  'in the same body, it is greater near to the earth, and less at remoter '
  'dis-\n'
  'tances. This sort of quantity is the centripetency, or propension of the\n'
  'whole body towards the centre, or, as I may say, its weight ; and it is '
  'al-\n'
  'ways known by the quantity of an equal and contrary force just sufficient\n'
  'to binder the descent of the body.\n'
  '\n'
  "'These quantities of forces, we may, for brevity's sake, call by the names\n"
  "of motive, accelerative, and absolute forces ; and, for distinction's sake, "
  'con-\n'
  'sider them, with respect to the bodies that tend to the centre; to the '
  'places\n'
  'of those bodies ; and to the centre of force towards which they tend ; '
  'that\n'
  'is to say, I refer the motive force to the body as an endeavour and '
  'propen-\n'
  'sity of the whole towards a centre, arising from the propensities of the\n'
  'several parts taken together; the accelerative force to the place of the\n'
  'body, as a certain power or energy diffused from the centre to all places\n'
  'around to move the bodies that are in them; and the absolute force to\n'
  'the centre, as endued with some cause, without which those motive forces\n'
  'would not be propagated through the spaces round about; whether that\n'
  'cause be some central body (such as is the load-stone, in the centre of '
  'the\n'
  'magnetic force, or the earth in the centre of the gravitating force), or\n'
  'anything else that does not yet appear. For I here design only to give a\n'
  'mathematical notion of those forces, without considering their physical\n'
  'causes and seats.\n'
  '\n'
  'Wherefore the accelerative force will stand in the same relation to the\n'
  'motive, as celerity does to motion. For the quantity of motion arises from\n'
  'the celerity drawn into the quantity of matter ; and the motive force '
  'arises\n'
  'from the accelerative force drawn into the same quantity of matter. For\n'
  'the sum of the actions of the accelerative force, upon the several ; '
  'articles\n'
  'of the body, is the motive force of the whole. Hence it is, that near the\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageBreak -->\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageHeader="OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY." -->\n'
  '\n'
  'surface of the earth, where the accelerative gravity, or force productive '
  'of\n'
  'gravity, in all bodies is the same, the motive gravity or the weight is as\n'
  'the body : but if we should ascend to higher regions, where the '
  'accelerative\n'
  'gravity is less, the weight would be equally diminished, and would always\n'
  'be as the product of the body, by the accelerative gravity. So in those '
  're-\n'
  'gions, where the accelerative gravity is diminished into one half, the '
  'weight\n'
  'of a body two or three times less, will be four or six times less.\n'
  '\n'
  'I likewise call attractions and impulses, in the same sense, accelerative,\n'
  'and motive; and use the words attraction, impulse or propensity of any\n'
  'sort towards a centre, promiscuously, and indifferently, one for another ;\n'
  'considering those forces not physically, but mathematically : wherefore, '
  'the\n'
  'reader is not to imagine, that by those words, I anywhere take upon me to\n'
  'define the kind, or the manner of any action, the causes or the physical\n'
  'reason thereof, or that I attribute forces, in a true and physical sense, '
  'to\n'
  'certain centres (which are only mathematical points) ; when at any time I\n'
  'happen to speak of centres as attracting, or as endued with attractive\n'
  'powers.\n'
  '\n'
  '\n'
  '## SCHOLIUM.\n'
  '\n'
  'Hitherto I have laid down the definitions of such words as are less\n'
  'known, and explained the sense in which I would have them to be under-\n'
  'stood in the following discourse. I do not define time, space, place and\n'
  'motion, as being well known to all. Only I must observe, that the vulgar\n'
  'conceive those quantities under no other notions but from the relation '
  'they\n'
  'bear to sensible objects. And thence arise certain prejudices, for the re-\n'
  'moving of which, it will be convenient to distinguish them into absolute\n'
  'and relative, true and apparent, mathematical and common.\n'
  '\n'
  'I. Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own na-\n'
  'ture flows equably without regard to anything external, and by another\n'
  'name is called duration : relative, apparent, and common time, is some '
  'sen-\n'
  'sible and external (whether accurate or unequable) measure of duration by\n'
  'the means of motion, which is commonly used instead of true time; such\n'
  'as an hour, a day, a month, a year.\n'
  '\n'
  'II. Absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything exter-\n'
  'nal, remains always similar and immovable. Relative space is some mo-\n'
  'vable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces; which our senses de-\n'
  'termine by its position to bodies ; and which is vulgarly taken for immo-\n'
  'vable space; such is the dimension of a subterraneous, an æreal, or '
  'celestial\n'
  'space, determined by its position in respect of the earth. Absolute and\n'
  'relative space, are the same in figure and magnitude ; but they do not re-\n'
  'main always numerically the same. For if the earth, for instance, moves,\n'
  'a space of our air, which relatively and in respect of the earth remains '
  'al-\n'
  'ways the same, will at one time be one part of the absolute space into '
  'which\n'

  "## THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE\n"
  '\n'
  'SINCE the ancients (as we are told by Pappus), made great account of\n'
  'the science of mechanics in the investigation of natural things; and the\n'
  'moderns, laying aside substantial forms and occult qualities, have endeav-\n'
  'oured to subject the phenomena of nature to the laws of mathematics, I\n'
  'have in this treatise cultivated mathematics so far as it regards '
  'philosophy.\n'
  'The ancients considered mechanics in a twofold respect ; as rational, '
  'which\n'
  'proceeds accurately by demonstration ; and practical. To practical me-\n'
  'chanics all the manual arts belong, from which mechanics took its name.\n'
  'But as artificers do not work with perfect accuracy, it comes to pass that\n'
  'mechanics is so distinguished from geometry, that what is perfectly accu-\n'
  'rate is called geometrical ; what is less so, is called mechanical. But '
  'the\n'
  'errors are not in the art, but in the artif.cers. He that works with less\n'
  'accuracy is an imperfect mechanic; and if any could work with perfect\n'
  'accuracy, he would be the most perfect mechanic of all ; for the '
  'description\n'
  'of right lines and circles, upon which geometry is founded, belongs to me-\n'
  'chanics. Geometry does not teach us to draw these lines, but requires\n'
  'them to be drawn ; for it requires that the learner should first be taught\n'
  'to describe these accurately, before he enters upon geometry ; then it '
  'shows\n'
  'how by these operations problems may be solved. To describe right lines\n'
  "and circles are problems, but not geometrical problems. 'The solution of\n"
  'these problems is required from mechanics; and by geometry the use of\n'
  'them, when so solved, is shown ; and it is the glory of geometry that from\n'
  'those few principles, brought from without, it is able to produce so many\n'
  'things. Therefore geometry is founded in mechanical practice, and is\n'
  'nothing but that part of universal mechanics which accurately proposes\n'
  'and demonstrates the art of measuring. But since the manual arts are\n'
  'chiefly conversant in the moving of bodies, it comes to pass that geometry\n'
  'is commonly referred to their magnitudes, and mechanics to their motion.\n'
  'In this sense rational mechanics will be the science of motions resulting\n'
  'from any forces whatsoever, and of the forces required to produce any mo-\n'
  'tions, accurately proposed and demonstrated. This part of mechanics was\n'

  '\n'
  'cultivated by the ancients in the five powers which relate to manual arts\n'
  'who considered gravity (it not being a manual power), no otherwise than\n'
  'as it moved weights by those powers. Our design not respecting arts, but\n'
  'philosophy, and our subject not manual but natural powers, we consider\n'
  'chiefly those things which relate to gravity, levity, elastic force, the '
  'resist-\n'
  'ance of fluids, and the like forces, whether attractive or impulsive; and\n'
  'therefore we offer this work as the mathematical principles : f philosophy '
  '; for\n'
  'all the difficulty of philosophy seems to consist in this -- from the '
  'phænom-\n'
  'ena of motions to investigate the forces of nature, and then from these\n'
  'forces to demonstrate the other phenomena; and to this end the general\n'
  'propositions in the first and second book are directed. In the third book\n'
  'we give an example of this in the explication of the System of the World ;\n'
  'for by the propositions mathematically demonstrated in the former books,\n'
  'we in the third derive from the celestial phenomena the forces of gravity\n'
  'with which bodies tend to the sun and the several planets. Then from these\n'
  'forces, by other propositions which are also mathematical, we deduce the '
  'mo-\n'
  'tions of the planets, the comets, the moon, and the sea. I wish we could '
  'de-\n'
  'rive the rest of the phenomena of nature by the same kind of reasoning '
  'from\n'
  'mechanical principles ; for I am induced by many reasons to suspect that\n'
  'they may all depend upon certain forces by which the particles of bodies,\n'
  'by some causes hitherto unknown, are either mutually impelled towards\n'
  'each other, and cohere in regular figures, or are repelled and recede from\n'
  'each other; which forces being unknown, philosophers have hitherto at-\n'
  'tempted the search of nature in vain; but I hope the principles here laid\n'
  'down will afford some light either to this or some truer method of '
  'philosophy.\n'
  '\n'
  'In the publication of this work the most acute and universally learned\n'
  'Mr. Edmund Halley not only assisted me with his pains in correcting the\n'
  'press and taking care of the schemes, but it was to his solicitations that '
  'its\n'
  'becoming public is owing ; for when he had obtained of me my demonstra-\n'
  'tions of the figure of the celestial orbits, he continually pressed me to '
  'com-\n'
  'municate the same to the Royal Society, who afterwards, by their kind en-\n'
  'couragement and entreaties, engaged me to think of publishing them. But\n'
  'after I had begun to consider the inequalities of the lunar motions, and\n'
  'had entered upon some other things relating to the laws and measures of\n'
  'gravity, and other forces ; and the figures that would be described by '
  'bodie?\n'
  'attracted according to given laws ; and the motion of several bodies '
  'moving\n'
  'among themselves ; the motion of bodies in resisting mediums; the forces,\n'
  'densities, and motions, of m‹ liums ; the orbits of the comets, and such '
  'like ;\n'

  'deferred that publication till I had made a search into those matters, and\n'
  'could put forth the whole together. What relates to the lunar motions (be-\n'
  'ing imperfect), I have put all together in the corollaries of Prop. 66, to\n'
  'avoid being obliged to propose and distinctly demonstrate the several '
  'things\n'
  'there contained in a method more prolix than the subject deserved, and in-\n'
  'terrupt the series of the several propositions. Some things, found out '
  'after\n'
  'the rest, I chose to insert in places less suitable, rather than change '
  'the\n'
  'number of the propositions and the citations. I heartily beg that what 1\n'
  'have here done may be read with candour; and that the defects in a\n'
  'subject so difficult be not so much reprehended as kindly supplied, and '
  'in-\n'
  'vestigated by new endeavours of my readers.\n'

  'In the second edition the second section of the first book was enlarged.\n'
  'In the seventh section of the second book the theory of the resistances of '
  'fluids\n'
  'was more accurately investigated, and confirmed by new experiments. In\n'
  "the third book the moon's theory and the præcession of the equinoxes were\n"
  'more fully deduced from their principles; and the theory of the comets\n'
  'was confirmed by more examples of the calculation of their orbits, done\n'
  'also with greater accuracy.\n'
  '\n'
  'In this third edition the resistance of mediums is somewhat more largely\n'
  'handled than before; and new experiments of the resistance of heavy\n'
  'bodies falling in air are added. In the third book, the argument to '

 ['Two traditions were held\n'
  'in the family: one, that they were of Scotch extraction ; the\n'
  'other, that they came originally from Newton, in Lancashire,\n'
  'dwelling, for a time, however, at Westby, county of Lincoln, be-\n'
  'fore the removal to and purchase of Woolsthorpe-about a hundred\n'
  'years before this memorable birth.\n'
  '\n'
  'The widow Newton was left with the simple means of a com-\n'
  'fortable subsistence. The Woolsthorpe estate together with\n'
  'small one which she possessed at Sewstern, in Leicestershire, yield\n'
  'ed her an income of some eighty pounds ; and upon this limited sum,\n'
  '. she had to rely chiefly for the support of herself, and the educa\n'
  'tion of her child. She continued his nurture for three years,\n'
  'when, marrying again, she confided the tender charge to the care\n'
  'of her own mother.\n'
  '\n'
  'Great genius is seldom marked by precocious development ;\n'
  'and young Isaac, sent, at the usual age, to two day schools at\n'
  'Skillington and Stoke, exhibited no unusual traits of character.\n'
  'In his twelfth year, he was placed at the public school at Gran-\n'
  'tham, and boarded at the house of Mr. Clark, an apothecary.\n'
  'But even in this excellent seminary, his mental acquisitions con-\n'
  'tinued for a while unpromising enough : study apparently had no\n'
  'charms for him ; he was very inattentive, and ranked low in the\n'
  'school. One day, however, the boy immediately above our seem-\n'
  'ingly dull student gave him a severe kick in the stomach ; Isaac,\n'
  'deeply affected, but with no outburst of passion, betook himself,\n'
  'with quiet, incessant toil, to his books ; he quickly passed above\n'
  'the offending classmate ; yet there he stopped not ; the strong\n'
  'spirit was, for once and forever, awakened, and, yielding to its\n'
  'noble impulse, he speedily took up his position at the head of all.\n'
  '\n'
  'His peculiar character began now rapidly to unfold itself.\n'
  'Close application grew to be habitual. Observation alternated\n'
  'with reflection. " A sober, silent, thinking lad," yet, the wisest\n'
  'and the kindliest, the indisputable leader of his fellows. Gener-\n'

  '\n'
  'osity, modesty, and a love of truth distinguished him then as ever\n'
  'afterwards. He did not often join his classmates in play ; but he\n'
  'would contrive for them various amusements of a scientific kind.\n'
  'Paper kites he introduced ; carefully determining their best form\n'
  'and proportions, and the position and number of points whereby\n'
  'to attach the string. He also invented paper lanterns ; these\n'
  'served ordinarily to guide the way to school in winter mornings,\n'
  'but occasionally for quite another purpose ; they were attached to\n'
  'the tails of kites in a dark night, to the dismay of the country people\n'
  'dreading portentous comets, and to the immeasureable delight of\n'
  'his companions. To him, however, young as he was, life seemed\n'
  'to have become an earnest thing. When not occupied with his\n'
  'studies, his mind would be engrossed with mechanical contrivances ;\n'
  'now imitating, now inventing. He became singularly skilful in the\n'
  'use of his little saws, hatchets, hammers, and other tools. A\n'
  'windmill was erected near Grantham ; during the operations of\n'
  'the workmen, he was frequently present ; in a short time, he had\n'
  'completed a perfect working model of it, which elicited general\n'
  'admiration. Not content, however, with this exact imitation, he\n'
  'conceived the idea of employing, in the place of sails, animal power ,\n'
  'and, adapting the construction of his mill accordingly, he enclosed\n'
  'in it a mouse, called the miller, and which by acting on a sort of\n'
  'treadwheel, gave motion to the machine. He invented, too, a\n'
  'mechanical carriage-having four wheels, and put in motion with\n'
  'a handle worked by the person sitting inside. The measurement\n'
  'of time early drew his attention. He first constructed a water\n'
  'clock, in proportions somewhat like an old-fashioned house clock.\n'
  'The index of the dial plate was turned by a piece of wood acted\n'
  'upon by dropping water. This instrument, though long used by\n'
  "himself, and by Mr. Clark's family, did not satisfy his inquiring\n"
  'mind. His thoughts rose to the sun ; and, by careful and oft-re-\n'
  'peated observations of the solar movements, he subsequently\n'
  "formed many dials. One of these, named Isaac's dial, was the\n"
  "accurate result of years' labour, and was frequently referred to\n"
  'for the hour of the day by the country people.\n'
  '\n'
  'May we not discern in these continual efforts-the diligent re\n'
  'search, the patient meditation, the aspiring glance, and the energy\n'

  'of discovery-the stirring elements of that wondrous spirit,\n'
  'which, clear, calm, and great, moved, in after years, through\n'
  "deep onward through deep of Nature's mysteries, unlocking her\n"
  'strongholds, dispelling darkness, educing order-everywhere si-\n'
  'lently conquering.\n'
  '\n'
  'Newton had an early and decided taste for drawing. Pictures,\n'
  'taken sometimes from copies, but often from life, and drawn,\n'
  'coloured and framed by himself, ornamented his apartment. He\n'
  'was skilled also, in poetical composition, “ excelled in making\n'
  'verses ;" some of these were borne in remembrance and repeated,\n'
  'seventy years afterward, by Mrs. Vincent, for whom, in early\n'
  'youth, as Miss Storey, he formed an ardent attachment. She\n'
  'was the sister of a physician resident near Woolsthorpe ; but\n'
  "Newton's intimate acquaintance with her began at Grantham,\n"
  'where they were both numbered among the inmates of the same\n'
  'house. Two or three years younger than himself, of great per-\n'
  'sonal beauty, and unusual talent, her society afforded him the\n'
  'greatest pleasure ; and their youthful friendship, it is believed,\n'
  'gradually rose to a higher passion ; but inadequacy of fortune\n'
  'prevented their union. Miss Storey was afterwards twice mar-\n'
  'ried ; Newton, never; his esteem for her continued unabated\n'
  'during life, accompanied by numerous acts of attention and\n'
  'kindness.\n'
  '\n'
  "In 1656, Newton's mother was again left a widow, and took\n"
  'up her abode once more at Woolsthorpe. He was now fifteen\n'
  'years of age, and had made great progress in his studies ; but she,\n'
  'desirous of his help, and from motives of economy, recalled him\n'
  'from school. Business occupations, however, and the manage-\n'
  'ment of the farm, proved utterly distasteful to him. When sent to\n'
  'Grantham Market on Saturdays, he would betake himself to his\n'
  "former lodgings in the apothecary's garret, where some of Mr.\n"
  "Clark's old books employed his thoughts till the aged and trust-\n"
  'worthy servant had executed the family commissions and announced\n'
  'the necessity of return : or, at other times, our young philosopher\n'
  'would seat himself under a hedge, by the wayside, and continue\n'
  'his studies till the same faithful personage-proceeding alone to\n'
  "the town and completing the day's business-stopped as he re-\n"

  'the air which he enjoyed there, and the state of absolute rest,\n'
  'proved of great benefit to him. Nevertheless he would occasion-\n'
  'ally go to town. And on Tuesday, the 28th of February, 1727,\n'
  'he proceeded to London, for the purpose of presiding at a meeting\n'
  'of the Royal Society. At this time his health was considered,\n'
  'by Mr. Conduit, better than it had been for many years. But\n'
  'the unusual fatigue he was obliged to suffer, in attending the\n'
  'meeting, and in paying and receiving visits, speedily produced a\n'
  'violent return of the affection in the bladder. He returned to\n'
  'Kensington on Saturday, the 4th of March. Dr. Mead and Dr.\n'
  'Cheselden attended him; they pronounced his disease to be the\n'
  'stone, and held out no hopes of recovery. On Wednesday, the\n'
  '15th of March, he seemed a little better; and slight, though\n'
  'groundless, encouragement was felt that he might survive the\n'
  'attack. From the very first of it, his sufferings had been intense.\n'
  'Paroxysm followed paroxysm, in quick succession : large drops\n'
  'of sweat rolled down his face ; but not a groan, not a complaint,\n'
  'not the least mark of peevishness or impatience escaped him :\n'
  'and during the short intervals of relief, he even smiled and con-\n'
  'versed with his usual composure and cheerfulness. The flesh\n'
  'quivered, but the heart quaked not ; the impenetrable gloom was\n'
  'settling down: the Destroyer near; the portals of the tomb\n'
  'opening, still, amid this utter wreck and dissolution of the mortal,\n'
  'the immortal remained serene, unconquerable : the radiant light\n'
  'broke through the gathering darkness; and Death yielded up its\n'
  'sting, and the grave its victory. On Saturday morning, 18th,\n'
  'he read the newspapers, and carried on a pretty long conversation\n'
  'with Dr. Mead. His senses and faculties were then strong and\n'
  "vigorous ; but at six o'clock, the same evening, he became insen-\n"
  'sible ; and in this state he continued during the whole of Sunday,\n'
  'and till Monday, the 20th, when he expired, between one and\n'
  "two o'clock in the morning, in the eighty-fifth year of his age.\n"
  '\n'
  'And these were the last days of Isaac Newton. Thus closed\n'
  "the career of one of earth's greatest and best men. His mission\n"
  'was fulfilled. Unto the Giver, in many-fold addition, the talents\n'
  'were returned. While it was yet day he had worked; and for\n'
  'the night that quickly cometh he was not unprepared. Full of\n'

  'years, and full of honours, the heaven-sent was recalled; and, in\n'
  'the confidence of a " certain hope," peacefully he passed away\n'
  'into the silent depths of Eternity.\n'
  '\n'
  'His body was placed in Westminster Abbey, with the state\n'
  'and ceremonial that usually attended the interment of the most\n'
  'distinguished. In 1731, his relatives, the inheritors of his personal\n'
  'estate, erected a monument to his memory in the most conspicu-\n'
  'cus part of the Abbey, which had often been refused by the dean\n'
  "and chapter to the greatest of England's nobility. During the\n"
  'same year a medal was struck at the Tower in his honour ; and,\n'
  'in 1755, a full-length statue of him, in white marble, admirably\n'
  'executed, by Roubiliac, at the expense of Dr. Robert Smith, was\n'
  'erected in the ante-chamber of Trinity College, Cambridge.\n'
  'There is a painting executed in the glass of one of the windows\n'
  'of the same college, made pursuant to the will of Dr. Smith, who\n'
  'left five hundred pounds for that purpose.\n'
  '\n'
  'Newton left a personal estate of about thirty-two thousand\n'
  'pounds. It was divided among his four nephews and four nieces\n'
  'of the half blood, the grand-children of his mother, by the Reve-\n'
  'rend Mr. Smith. The family estates of Woolsthorpe and Sustern\n'
  'fell to John Newton, the heir-at-law, whose great grand-father\n'
  "was Sir Isaac's uncle. Before his death he made an equitable\n"
  'distribution of his two other estates: the one in Berkshire to the\n'
  'sons and daughter of a brother of Mrs. Conduit ; and the other,\n'
  'at Kensington, to Catharine, the only daughter of Mr. Conduit,\n'
  'and who afterward became Viscountess Lymington. Mr. Con-\n'
  'duit succeeded to the offices of the Mint, the duties of which he\n'
  "had discharged during the last two years of Sir Isaac's life.\n"

  'The manor-house, at Woolsthorpe, was visited by Dr. Stuke\n'
  'ley, in October, 1721, who, in a letter to Dr. Mead, written in\n'
  '1727, gave the following description of it :- " "T\'is built of stone,\n'
  'as is the way of the country hereabouts, and a reasonably good\n'
  "one. They led me up stairs and showed me Sir Isaac's study,\n"
  'where I supposed he studied, when in the country, in his younger\n'
  'days, or perhaps when he visited his mother from the University.\n'
  'I observed the shelves were of his own making, being pieces of\n'
  'deal boxes, which probably he sent his books and clothes down\n'
  'in on those occasions. There were, some years ago, two or three\n'
  'hundred books in it of his father-in-law, Mr. Smith, which Sır\n'
  'Isaac gave to Dr. Newton, of our town." The celebrated apple-\n'
  'tree, the fall of one of the apples of which is said to have turned\n'
  'the attention of Newton to the subject of gravity, was destroyed\n'
  'by the wind about twenty years ago; but it has been preserved\n'
  'in the form of a chair. The house itself has been protected with\n'
  'religious care. It was repaired in 1798, and a tablet of white\n'
  'marble put up in the room where our author was born, with the\n'
  'following inscription :-\n'
  '\n'
  '" Sir Isaac Newton, son of John Newton, Lord of the Manor\n'
  'of Woolsthorpe, was born in this room, on the 25th of December,\n'
  '1642."\n'

  'It was not till the month of June, 1669, that our author made\n'
  'known his Method of Fluxions. He then communicated the\n'
  'work which he had composed upon the subject, and entitled,\n'
  'ANALYSIS PER EQUATIONES NUMERO TERMINORUM INFINITAS,\n'
  'to his friend Dr. Barrow. The latter, in a letter dated 20th of the\n'
  'same month, mentioned it to Mr. Collins, and transmitted it to\n'
  'him, on the 31st of July thereafter. Mr. Collins greatly approv.\n'
  'ed of the work ; took a copy of it; and sent the original back\n'
  'to Dr. Barrow. During the same and the two following years, Mr\n'

  'Collins, by his extensive correspondence, spread the knowledge\n'
  'of this discovery among the mathematicians in England, Scotland,\n'
  'France, Holland and Italy.\n'
  '\n'
  'Dr. Barrow, having resolved to devote himself to Theology,\n'
  'resigned the Lucasian Professorship of Mathematics, in 1669, in\n'
  'favour of Newton, who accordingly received the appointment to\n'
  'the vacant chair.\n'
  '\n'
  'During the years 1669, 1670, and 1671, our author, as such\n'
  'Professor, delivered a course of Optical Lectures. Though these\n'
  'contained his principal discoveries relative to the different re-\n'
  'frangibility of light, yet the discoveries themselves did not be-\n'
  'come publicly known, it seems, till he communicated them to the\n'
  'Royal Society, a few weeks after being elected a member there-\n'
  'of, in the spring of 1671-2. He now rose rapidly in reputation,\n'
  'and was soon regarded as foremost among the philosophers of the\n'
  'age. His paper on light excited the deepest interest in the Royal\n'
  'Society, who manifested an anxious solicitude to secure the author\n'
  'from the " arrogations of others," and proposed to publish his\n'
  'discourse in the monthly numbers in which the Transactions were\n'
  'given to the world. Newton, gratefully sensible of these expres-\n'
  'sions of esteem, willingly accepted of the proposal for publication.\n'
  'He gave them also, at this time, the results of some further ex-\n'
  'periments in the decomposition and re-composition of light :- that\n'
  'the same degree of refrangibility always belonged to the same\n'
  'colour, and the same colour to the same degree of refrangibility :\n'
  'that the seven different colours of the spectrum were original, or\n'
  'simple, and that whiteness, or white light was a compound of all\n'
  'these seven colours.\n'
  '\n'
  'The publication of his new doctrines on light soon called forth\n'
  'violent opposition as to their soundness. Hooke and Huygens-\n'
  'men eminent for ability and learning-were the most conspic vous\n'
  'of the assailants. And though Newton effectually silenced all his\n'
  'adversaries, yet he felt the triumph of little gain in comparison\n'
  'with the loss his tranquillity had sustained. He subsequently re-\n'
  'narked in allusion to this controversy-and to one with whom\n'
  'he was destined to have a longer and a bitterer conflict-" I was\n'
  'so persecuted with discussions arising from the publication of my\n'

  'theory of light, that I blamed my own imprudence for parting\n'
  'with so substantial a blessing as my quiet to run after a shadow.".\n'
  '\n'
  'In a communication to Mr. Oldenburg, Secretary of the Royal\n'
  'Society, in 1672, our author stated many valuable suggestions re-\n'
  'lative to the construction of REFLECTING MICROSCOPES which he\n'
  'considered even more capable of improvement than telescopes.\n'
  'He also contemplated, about the same time, an edition of Kinck-\n'
  "huysen's Algebra, with notes and additions ; partially arranging,\n"
  'as an introduction to the work, a treatise, entitled, A Method of\n'
  'Fluxions ; but he finally abandoned the design. This treatise,\n'
  'however, he resolved, or rather consented, at a late period of his\n'
  'life, to put forth separately ; and the plan would probably have\n'
  'been carried into execution had not his death intervened. It was\n'
  'translated into English, and published in 1736 by John Colson,\n'
  'Professor of Mathematics in Cambridge.\n'
  '\n'
  'Newton, it is thought, made his discoveries concerning the\n'
  'INFLECTION and DIFFRACTION of light before 1674. The phe-\n'
  'nomena of the inflection of light had been first discovered more\n'
  'than ten years before by Grimaldi. And Newton began by re-\n'
  'peating one of the experiments of the learned Jesuit-admitting\n'
  "a beam of the sun's light through a small pin hole into a dark\n"
  'chamber : the light diverged from the aperture in the form of a\n'
  'cone, and the shadows of all bodies placed in this light were\n'
  'larger than might have been expected, and surrounded with three\n'
  'coloured fringes, the nearest being widest, and the most remote\n'
  'the narrowest. Newton, advancing upon this experiment, took\n'
  'exact measures of the diameter of the shadow of a human hair,\n'
  'and of the breadth of the fringes, at different distances behind it,\n'
  'and discovered that these diameters and breadths were not pro-\n'
  'portional to the distances at which they were measured. He\n'
  'hence supposed that the rays which passed by the edge of the\n'
  'hair were deflected or turned aside from it, as if by a repulsive\n'
  'force, the nearest rays suffering the greatest, the more remote a\n'
  'less degree of deflection. In explanation of the coloured fringes,\n'
  'he queried : whether the rays which differ in refrangibility do not\n'
  'differ also in flexibility, and whether they are not, by these dif-\n'
  'ferent inflections, separated from one another, so as after separa-\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageBreak -->\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageNumber="24" -->\n'
  '<!-- PageHeader="LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON." -->\n'
  '\n'
  'tion to make the colours in the three fringes above described ?\n'
  'Also, whether the rays, in passing by the edges and sides of\n'
  'bodies, are not bent several times backwards and forwards with\n'
  'an eel-like motion-the three fringes arising from three such\n'
  'bendings ? His inquiries on this subject were here interrupted\n'
  'and never renewed.\n'
  '\n'
  'His Theory of the COLOURS of NATURAL BODIES was commu-\n'
  'nicated to the Royal Society, in February, 1675. This is justly\n'
  'regarded as one of the profoundest of his speculations. The fun-\n'
  'damental principles of the Theory in brief, are :- That bodies\n'
  'possessing the greatest refractive powers reflect the greatest\n'
  'quantity of light ; and that, at the confines of equally refracting\n'
  'media, there is no reflection. That the minutest particles of al-\n'
  'most all natural bodies are in some degree transparent. That\n'
  'between the particles of bodies there are pores, or spaces, either\n'
  'empty or filled with media of a less density than the particles\n'
  'themselves. That these particles, and pores or spaces, have some\n'
  'definite size. Hence he deduced the Transparency, Opacity, and\n'
  'colours of natural bodies. Transparency arises from the particles\n'
  'and their pores being too small to cause reflection at their com-\n'
  'mon surfaces-the light all passing through ; Opacity from the\n'
  'opposite cause of the particles and their pores being sufficiently\n'
  'large to reflect the light which is " stopped or stifled" by the\n',
  '\n'
  'turned. The more immediate affairs of the farm received no\n'
  'better attention. In fact, his passion for study grew daily more\n'
  'absorbing, and his dislike for every other occupation more in-\n'
  'tense. His mother, therefore, wisely resolved to give him all the\n'
  'advantages which an education could confer. He was sent back\n'
  'to Grantham school, where he remained for some months in busy\n'
  'preparation for his academical studies. At the recommendation\n'
  'of one of his uncles, who had himself studied at Trinity College,\n'
  'Cambridge, Newton proceeded thither, and was duly admitted,\n'
  'on the 5th day of June 1660, in the eighteenth year of his age.\n'
  '\n'
  'The eager student had now entered upon a new and wider\n'
  'field ; and we find him devoting himself to the pursuit of know-\n'
  'ledge with amazing ardour and perseverance. Among other sub-\n'
  'jects, his attention was soon drawn to that of Judicial Astrology\n'
  'He exposed the folly of this pseudo-science by erecting a figure\n'
  'with the aid of one or two of the problems of Euclid ;- and thus\n'
  'began his study of the Mathematics. His researches into this\n'
  'science were prosecuted with unparallelled vigour and success.\n'
  'Regarding the propositions contained in Euclid as self-evident\n'
  'truths, he passed rapidly over this ancient system-a step which\n'
  'he afterward much regretted-and mastered, without further pre-\n'
  "paratory study, the Analytical Geometry of Descartes. Wallis's\n"
  "Arithmetic of Infinites, Saunderson's Logic, and the Optics of\n"
  'Kepler, he also studied with great care; writing upon them\n'
  "many comments ; and, in these notes on Wallis's work was un-\n"
  'doubtedly the germ of his fluxionary calculus. His progress was\n'
  'so great that he found himself more profoundly versed than his tutor\n'
  'in many branches of learning. Yet his acquisitions were not\n'
  'gotten with the rapidity of intuition ; but they were thoroughly\n'
  'made and firmly secured. Quickness of apprehension, or intel\n'
  'lectual nimbleness did not belong to him. He saw too far : his.\n'
  'insight was too deep. He dwelt fully, cautiously upon the least\n'
  'subject ; while to the consideration of the greatest, he brought a\n'
  'massive strength joined with a matchless clearness, that, regard-\n'
  'less of the merely trivial or unimportant, bore with unerring sa-\n'
  'gacity upon the prominences of the subject, and, grappling with\n'
  'its difficulties, rarely failed to surmount them.\n'

  'His early and fast friend, Dr. Barrow-in compass of inven-\n'
  'tion only inferior to Newton-who had been elected Professor\n'
  'of Greek in the University, in 1660, was made Lucasian Profes-\n'
  'sor of Mathematics in 1663, and soon afterward delivered his\n'
  'Optical Lectures : the manuscripts of these were revised by New-\n'
  'ton, and several oversights corrected, and many important sug-\n'
  'gestions made by him ; but they were not published till 1669.\n'
  '\n'
  'In the year 1665, he received the degree of Bachelor of Arts ;\n'
  'and, in 1666, he entered upon those brilliant and imposing dis-\n'
  'coveries which have conferred inappreciable benefits upon science,\n'
  'and immortality upon his own name.\n'
  '\n'
  'Newton, himself, states that he was in possession of his Method\n'
  'of Fluxions, " in the year 1666, or before." Infinite quantities\n'
  'had long been a subject of profound investigation ; among the\n'
  'ancients by Archimedes, and Pappus of Alexandria ; among the\n'
  'moderns by Kepler, Cavaleri, Roberval, Fermat and Wallis.\n'
  'With consummate ability Dr. Wallis had improved upon the la-\n'
  'bours of his predecessors : with a higher power, Newton moved\n'
  'forwards from where Wallis stopped. Our author first invented\n'
  'his celebrated BINOMIAL THEOREM. And then, applying this\n'
  'Theorem to the rectification of curves, and to the determination\n'
  'of the surfaces and contents of solids, and the position of their\n'
  'centres of gravity, he discovered the general principle of deducing\n'
  'the areas of curves from the ordinate, by considering the area as\n'
  'a nascent quantity, increasing by continual fluxion in the propor-\n'
  'tion of the length of the ordinate, and supposing the abscissa\n'
  'to increase uniformly in proportion to the time. Regarding lines\n'
  'as generated by the motion of points, surfaces by the motion of\n'
  'lines, and solids by the motion of surfaces, and considering that.\n'
  'the ordinates, abscissae, &c., of curves thus formed, vary accord-\n'
  'ing to a regular law depending on the equation of the curve,\n'
  'he deduced from this equation the velocities with which these\n'
  'quantities are generated, and obtained by the rules of infinite\n'
  'series, the ultimate value required. To the velocities with which\n'
  'every line or quantity is generated, he gave the name of FLUX-\n'
  'IONS, and to the lines or quantities themselves, that of FLUENTS.\n'

  '\n'
  'intellects :-- that, variously modified, has proved of incalculable\n'
  'service in aiding to develope the most abstruse and the highest\n'
  'truths in Mathematics and Astronomy : and that was of itself\n'
  'enough to render any name illustrious in the crowded Annals of\n'
  'Science.\n'
  '\n'
  'At this period, the most distinguished philosophers were direct-\n'
  'ing all their energies to the subject of light and the improvement\n'
  'of the refracting telescope. Newton, having applied himself to\n'
  'the grinding of "optic glasses of other figures than spherical," ex-\n'
  'perienced the impracticability of executing such lenses ; and con-\n'
  'jectured that their defects, and consequently those of refracting\n'
  'telescopes, might arise from some other cause than the imperfect\n'
  'convergency of rays to a single point. He accordingly "procured\n'
  'a triangular glass prism to try therewith the celebrated phenom-\n'
  'ena of colours." His experiments, entered upon with zeal, and\n'
  'conducted with that industry, accuracy, and patient thought, for\n'
  'which he was so remarkable, resulted in the grand conclusion,\n'
  'that LIGHT WAS NOT HOMOGENEOUS, BUT CONSISTED OF RAYS,\n'
  'SOME OF WHICH WERE MORE REFRANGIBLE THAN OTHERS. This\n'
  'profound and beautiful discovery opened up a new era in the\n'
  'History of Optics. As bearing, however, directly upon the construc-\n'
  'tion of telescopes, he saw that a lens refracting exactly like a prism\n'
  'would necessarily bring the different rays to different foci, at\n'
  'different distances from the glass, confusing and rendering the\n'
  'vision indistinct. Taking for granted that all bodies produced\n'
  'spectra of · qual length, he dismissed all further consideration of\n'
  'the refracting instrument, and took up the principle of reflection.\n'
  'Rays of all colours, he found, were reflected regularly, so that the\n'
  'angle of reflection was equal to the angle of incidence, and hence\n'
  'he concluded that optical instruments might be brought to any\n'
  'degree of perfection imaginable, provided reflecting specula of\n'
  'the requisite figure and finish could be obtained. At this stage\n'
  'of his optical researches, he was forced to leave Cambridge on\n'
  'account of the plague which was then desolating England.\n'
  '\n'
  'He retired to Woolsthorpe. ',
  'The old manor-house, in which he\n'
  'was born, was situated in a beautiful little valley, on the west side\n'
  'of the river Witham ; and here in the quiet home of his boyhood,\n'

  'he passed his days in serene contemplation, while the stalking\n'
  'pestilence was hurrying its tens of thousands into undistinguisha .\n'
  'ble graves.\n'
  '\n'
  'Towards the close of a pleasant day in the early autumn of\n'
  '1666, he was seated alone beneath a tree, in his garden, absorbed\n'
  'in meditation. He was a slight young man ; in the twenty-fourth\n'
  'year of his age ; his countenance mild and full of thought. For\n'
  'a century previous, the science of Astronomy had advanced with\n'
  'rapid strides. The human mind had risen from the gloom and\n'
  'bondage of the middle ages, in unparalleled vigour, to unfold the\n'
  'system, to investigate the phenomena, and to establish the laws\n'
  'of the heavenly bodies. Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Kepler,\n'
  'Galileo, and others had prepared and lighted the way for him\n'
  'who was to give to their labour its just value, and to their genius\n'
  'its true lustre. At his bidding isolated facts were to take order\n'
  'as parts of one harmonious whole, and sagacious conjectures grow\n'
  'luminous in the certain splendour of demonstrated truth. And\n'
  'this ablest man had come-was here. His mind, familiar with\n'
  'the knowledge of past effort, and its unequalled faculties develop-\n'
  'ed in transcendant strength, was now moving on to the very\n'
  'threshold of its grandest achievement. Step by step the untrod-\n'
  'den path was measured, till, at length, the entrance seemed dis-\n'
  'closed, and the tireless explorer to stand amid the first opening\n'
  'wonders of the universe.\n'
  '\n'
  'The nature of gravity-that mysterious power which causes\n'
  'all bodies to descend towards the centre of the earth-had, in-\n'
  'deed, dawned upon him. And reason busily united link to link\n'
  'of that chain which was yet to be traced joining the least to the\n'
  'vastest, the most remote to the nearest, in one harmonious bond.\n'
  'From the bottoms of the deepest caverns to the summits of the\n'
  'highest mountains, this power suffers no sensible change : may not\n'
  'its action, then, extend to the moon ? Undoubtedly : and further\n'
  'reflection convinced him that such a power might be sufficient for\n'
  'retaining that luminary in her orbit round the earth. But, though\n'
  'this power suffers no sensible variation, in the little change of\n'
  "distance from the earth's centre, at which we may place our-\n"
  '"elves, yet, at the distance of the moon, may not its force undergo\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageBreak -->\n'
  '\n'
  '<!-- PageNumber="17" -->\n'
  '<!-- PageHeader="LIFE OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON." -->\n'
  '\n'
  'more or less diminution ? The conjecture appeared most proba-\n'
  'ble : and, in order to estimate what the degree of diminution\n'
  'might be, he considered that if the moon be retained in her orbit\n'
  'by the force of gravity, the primary planets must also be carried\n'
  'round the sun by the like power ; and, by comparing the periods\n'
  'of the several planets with their distances from the sun, he found\n'
  'that, if they were held in their courses by any power like gravity,\n'
  'its strength must decrease in the duplicate proportion of the in-\n'
  'crease of distance. In forming this conclusion, he supposed the\n'
  'planets to move in perfect circles, concentric to the sun. Now\n'
  "was this the law of the moon's motion ? Was such a force, em-\n"
  'anating from the earth and directed to the moon, sufficient, when\n'
  'diminished as the square of the distance, to retain her in her\n'
  'orbit ? To ascertain this master-fact, he compared the space\n'
  'through which heavy bodies fall, in a second of time, at a given\n'
  'distance from the centre of the earth, namely, at its surface, with\n'
  'the space through which the moon falls, as it were, to the earth,\n'
  'in the same time, while revolving in a circular orbit. He was\n'
  'absent from books; and, therefore, adopted, in computing the\n'
  "earth's diameter, the common estimate of sixty miles to a degree\n"
  'of latitude as then in use among geographers and navigators.\n'
  'The result of his calculations did not, of course, answer his ex-\n'
  'pectations ; hence, he concluded that some other cause, beyond the\n'
  'reach of observation-analogous, perhaps, to the vortices of Des-\n'
  'cartes-joined its action to that of the power of gravity upon the\n'
  'moon. Though by no means satisfied, he yet abandoned awhile\n'
  'further inquiry, and remained totally silent upon the subject.\n'
  '\n'
  'These rapid marches in the career of discovery, combined with\n'
  'the youth of Newton, seem to evince a penetration the most\n'
  'lively, and an invention the most exuberant. But in him there\n'
  'was a conjunction of influences as extraordinary as fortunate.\n'
  'Study, unbroker, persevering and profound carried on its inform-\n'

  'and rendered freest in its movements, and clearest in its vision,\n'

  'minute and the stupendous, brought these successively to light,\n'
  'and caused science to make them her own.\n'
  '\n'
  'In 1667, Newton was made a Junior Fellow ; and, in the year\n'
  'following, he took his degree of Master of Arts, and was appoint-\n'
  'ed to a Senior Fellowship.\n'
  '\n'
  'On his return to Cambridge, in 1668, he resumed his optical\n'
  'labours. Having thought of a delicate method of polishing metal,\n'
  'he proceeded to the construction of his newly projected reflect.\n'
  'ing telescope ; a small specimen of which he actually made with\n'
  'his own hands. It was six inches long ; and magnified about\n'
  'forty times ;- a power greater than a refracting instrument of six\n'
  'feet tube could exert with distinctness. Jupiter, with his four\n'
  'satellites, and the horns, or moon-like phases of Venus were\n'
  'plainly visible through it. THIS WAS THE FIRST REFLECTING\n'
  'TELESCOPE EVER EXECUTED AND DIRECTED TO THE HEAVENS.\n'
  'He gave an account of it, in a letter to a friend, dated February 23d,\n'
  '1668-9-a letter which is also remarkable for containing the first\n'
  'allusion to his discoveries " concerning the nature of light." En-\n'
  'couraged by the success of his first experiment, he again executed\n'
  'with his own hands, not long afterward, a second and superior\n'
  'instrument of the same kind. The existence of this having come\n'
  'to the knowledge of the Royal Society of London, in 1671, they\n'
  'requested it of Newton for examination. He accordingly sent it\n'
  'to them. It excited great admiration ; it was shown to the king ·\n'
  'a drawing and description of it was sent to Paris; and the tele-\n'
  'scope itself was carefully preserved in the Library of the Society.\n'
  'Newton lived to see his invention in public use, and of eminent\n'
  'service in the cause of science.\n'
  '\n'
  'In the spring of 1669, he wrote to his friend Francis Aston,\n'
  'Esq., then about setting out on his travels, a letter of advice and\n'
  'directions, it was dated May 18th, and is interesting as exhibit-\n'],
 ['Two traditions were held\n'
  'in the family: one, that they were of Scotch extraction ; the\n'
  'other, that they came originally from Newton, in Lancashire,\n'
  'dwelling, for a time, however, at Westby, county of Lincoln, be-\n'
  'fore the removal to and purchase of Woolsthorpe-about a hundred\n'
  'years before this memorable birth.\n'
  '\n'
  'The widow Newton was left with the simple means of a com-\n'
  'fortable subsistence. The Woolsthorpe estate together with\n'
  'small one which she possessed at Sewstern, in Leicestershire, yield\n'
  'ed her an income of some eighty pounds ; and upon this limited sum,\n'
  '. she had to rely chiefly for the support of herself, and the educa\n'
  'tion of her child. She continued his nurture for three years,\n'
  'when, marrying again, she confided the tender charge to the care\n'
  'of her own mother.\n'
  '\n'
  'Great genius is seldom marked by precocious development ;\n'
  'and young Isaac, sent, at the usual age, to two day schools at\n'
  'Skillington and Stoke, exhibited no unusual traits of character.\n'
  'In his twelfth year, he was placed at the public school at Gran-\n'
  'tham, and boarded at the house of Mr. Clark, an apothecary.\n'
  'But even in this excellent seminary, his mental acquisitions con-\n'
  'tinued for a while unpromising enough : study apparently had no\n'
  'charms for him ; he was very inattentive, and ranked low in the\n'
  'school. One day, however, the boy immediately above our seem-\n'
  'ingly dull student gave him a severe kick in the stomach ; Isaac,\n'
  'deeply affected, but with no outburst of passion, betook himself,\n'
  'with quiet, incessant toil, to his books ; he quickly passed above\n'
  'the offending classmate ; yet there he stopped not ; the strong\n'
  'spirit was, for once and forever, awakened, and, yielding to its\n'
  'noble impulse, he speedily took up his position at the head of all.\n'
  '\n'
  'His peculiar character began now rapidly to unfold itself.\n'
  'Close application grew to be habitual. Observation alternated\n'
  'with reflection. " A sober, silent, thinking lad," yet, the wisest\n'
  'and the kindliest, the indisputable leader of his fellows. Gener-\n'

  '\n'
  'osity, modesty, and a love of truth distinguished him then as ever\n'
  'afterwards. He did not often join his classmates in play ; but he\n'
  'would contrive for them various amusements of a scientific kind.\n'
  'Paper kites he introduced ; carefully determining their best form\n'
  'and proportions, and the position and number of points whereby\n'
  'to attach the string. He also invented paper lanterns ; these\n'
  'served ordinarily to guide the way to school in winter mornings,\n'
  'but occasionally for quite another purpose ; they were attached to\n'
  'the tails of kites in a dark night, to the dismay of the country people\n'
  'dreading portentous comets, and to the immeasureable delight of\n'
  'his companions. To him, however, young as he was, life seemed\n'
  'to have become an earnest thing. When not occupied with his\n'
  'studies, his mind would be engrossed with mechanical contrivances ;\n'
  'now imitating, now inventing. He became singularly skilful in the\n'
  'use of his little saws, hatchets, hammers, and other tools. A\n'
  'windmill was erected near Grantham ; during the operations of\n'
  'the workmen, he was frequently present ; in a short time, he had\n'
  'completed a perfect working model of it, which elicited general\n'
  'admiration. Not content, however, with this exact imitation, he\n'
  'conceived the idea of employing, in the place of sails, animal power ,\n'
  'and, adapting the construction of his mill accordingly, he enclosed\n'
  'in it a mouse, called the miller, and which by acting on a sort of\n'
  'treadwheel, gave motion to the machine. He invented, too, a\n'
  'mechanical carriage-having four wheels, and put in motion with\n'
  'a handle worked by the person sitting inside. The measurement\n'
  'of time early drew his attention. He first constructed a water\n'
  'clock, in proportions somewhat like an old-fashioned house clock.\n'
  'The index of the dial plate was turned by a piece of wood acted\n'
  'upon by dropping water. This instrument, though long used by\n'
  "himself, and by Mr. Clark's family, did not satisfy his inquiring\n"
  'mind. His thoughts rose to the sun ; and, by careful and oft-re-\n'
  'peated observations of the solar movements, he subsequently\n'
  "formed many dials. One of these, named Isaac's dial, was the\n"
  "accurate result of years' labour, and was frequently referred to\n"
  'for the hour of the day by the country people.\n'
  '\n'
  'May we not discern in these continual efforts-the diligent re\n'
  'search, the patient meditation, the aspiring glance, and the energy\n'

  '\n'
  'of discovery-the stirring elements of that wondrous spirit,\n'
  'which, clear, calm, and great, moved, in after years, through\n'
  "deep onward through deep of Nature's mysteries, unlocking her\n"
  'strongholds, dispelling darkness, educing order-everywhere si-\n'
  'lently conquering.\n'
  '\n'
  'Newton had an early and decided taste for drawing. Pictures,\n'
  'taken sometimes from copies, but often from life, and drawn,\n'
  'coloured and framed by himself, ornamented his apartment. He\n'
  'was skilled also, in poetical composition, “ excelled in making\n'
  'verses ;" some of these were borne in remembrance and repeated,\n'
  'seventy years afterward, by Mrs. Vincent, for whom, in early\n'
  'youth, as Miss Storey, he formed an ardent attachment. She\n'
  'was the sister of a physician resident near Woolsthorpe ; but\n'
  "Newton's intimate acquaintance with her began at Grantham,\n"
  'where they were both numbered among the inmates of the same\n'
  'house. Two or three years younger than himself, of great per-\n'
  'sonal beauty, and unusual talent, her society afforded him the\n'
  'greatest pleasure ; and their youthful friendship, it is believed,\n'
  'gradually rose to a higher passion ; but inadequacy of fortune\n'
  'prevented their union. Miss Storey was afterwards twice mar-\n'
  'ried ; Newton, never; his esteem for her continued unabated\n'
  'during life, accompanied by numerous acts of attention and\n'
  'kindness.\n'
  '\n'
  "In 1656, Newton's mother was again left a widow, and took\n"
  'up her abode once more at Woolsthorpe. He was now fifteen\n'
  'years of age, and had made great progress in his studies ; but she,\n'
  'desirous of his help, and from motives of economy, recalled him\n'
  'from school. Business occupations, however, and the manage-\n'
  'ment of the farm, proved utterly distasteful to him. When sent to\n'
  'Grantham Market on Saturdays, he would betake himself to his\n'
  "former lodgings in the apothecary's garret, where some of Mr.\n"
  "Clark's old books employed his thoughts till the aged and trust-\n"
  'worthy servant had executed the family commissions and announced\n'
  'the necessity of return : or, at other times, our young philosopher\n'
  'would seat himself under a hedge, by the wayside, and continue\n'
  'his studies till the same faithful personage-proceeding alone to\n'
  "the town and completing the day's business-stopped as he re-\n"

  'he passed his days in serene contemplation, while the stalking\n'
  'pestilence was hurrying its tens of thousands into undistinguisha .\n'
  'ble graves.\n'
  '\n'
  'Towards the close of a pleasant day in the early autumn of\n'
  '1666, he was seated alone beneath a tree, in his garden, absorbed\n'
  'in meditation. He was a slight young man ; in the twenty-fourth\n'
  'year of his age ; his countenance mild and full of thought. For\n'
  'a century previous, the science of Astronomy had advanced with\n'
  'rapid strides. The human mind had risen from the gloom and\n'
  'bondage of the middle ages, in unparalleled vigour, to unfold the\n'
  'system, to investigate the phenomena, and to establish the laws\n'
  'of the heavenly bodies. Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Kepler,\n'
  'Galileo, and others had prepared and lighted the way for him\n'
  'who was to give to their labour its just value, and to their genius\n'
  'its true lustre. At his bidding isolated facts were to take order\n'
  'as parts of one harmonious whole, and sagacious conjectures grow\n'
  'luminous in the certain splendour of demonstrated truth. And\n'
  'this ablest man had come-was here. His mind, familiar with\n'
  'the knowledge of past effort, and its unequalled faculties develop-\n'
  'ed in transcendant strength, was now moving on to the very\n'
  'threshold of its grandest achievement. Step by step the untrod-\n'
  'den path was measured, till, at length, the entrance seemed dis-\n'
  'closed, and the tireless explorer to stand amid the first opening\n'
  'wonders of the universe.\n'
  '\n'
  'The nature of gravity-that mysterious power which causes\n'
  'all bodies to descend towards the centre of the earth-had, in-\n'
  'deed, dawned upon him. And reason busily united link to link\n'
  'of that chain which was yet to be traced joining the least to the\n'
  'vastest, the most remote to the nearest, in one harmonious bond.\n'
  'From the bottoms of the deepest caverns to the summits of the\n'
  'highest mountains, this power suffers no sensible change : may not\n'
  'its action, then, extend to the moon ? Undoubtedly : and further\n'
  'reflection convinced him that such a power might be sufficient for\n'
  'retaining that luminary in her orbit round the earth. But, though\n'
  'this power suffers no sensible variation, in the little change of\n'
  "distance from the earth's centre, at which we may place our-\n"
  '"elves, yet, at the distance of the moon, may not its force undergo\n'

  '\n'
  'more or less diminution ? The conjecture appeared most proba-\n'
  'ble : and, in order to estimate what the degree of diminution\n'
  'might be, he considered that if the moon be retained in her orbit\n'
  'by the force of gravity, the primary planets must also be carried\n'
  'round the sun by the like power ; and, by comparing the periods\n'
  'of the several planets with their distances from the sun, he found\n'
  'that, if they were held in their courses by any power like gravity,\n'
  'its strength must decrease in the duplicate proportion of the in-\n'
  'crease of distance. In forming this conclusion, he supposed the\n'
  'planets to move in perfect circles, concentric to the sun. Now\n'
  "was this the law of the moon's motion ? Was such a force, em-\n"
  'anating from the earth and directed to the moon, sufficient, when\n'
  'diminished as the square of the distance, to retain her in her\n'
  'orbit ? To ascertain this master-fact, he compared the space\n'
  'through which heavy bodies fall, in a second of time, at a given\n'
  'distance from the centre of the earth, namely, at its surface, with\n'
  'the space through which the moon falls, as it were, to the earth,\n'
  'in the same time, while revolving in a circular orbit. He was\n'

  'the air which he enjoyed there, and the state of absolute rest,\n'
  'proved of great benefit to him. Nevertheless he would occasion-\n'
  'ally go to town. And on Tuesday, the 28th of February, 1727,\n'
  'he proceeded to London, for the purpose of presiding at a meeting\n'
  'of the Royal Society. At this time his health was considered,\n'
  'by Mr. Conduit, better than it had been for many years. But\n'
  'the unusual fatigue he was obliged to suffer, in attending the\n'
  'meeting, and in paying and receiving visits, speedily produced a\n'
  'violent return of the affection in the bladder. He returned to\n'
  'Kensington on Saturday, the 4th of March. Dr. Mead and Dr.\n'
  'Cheselden attended him; they pronounced his disease to be the\n'
  'stone, and held out no hopes of recovery. On Wednesday, the\n'
  '15th of March, he seemed a little better; and slight, though\n'
  'groundless, encouragement was felt that he might survive the\n'
  'attack. From the very first of it, his sufferings had been intense.\n'
  'Paroxysm followed paroxysm, in quick succession : large drops\n'
  'of sweat rolled down his face ; but not a groan, not a complaint,\n'
  'not the least mark of peevishness or impatience escaped him :\n'
  'and during the short intervals of relief, he even smiled and con-\n'
  'versed with his usual composure and cheerfulness. The flesh\n'
  'quivered, but the heart quaked not ; the impenetrable gloom was\n'
  'settling down: the Destroyer near; the portals of the tomb\n'
  'opening, still, amid this utter wreck and dissolution of the mortal,\n'
  'the immortal remained serene, unconquerable : the radiant light\n'
  'broke through the gathering darkness; and Death yielded up its\n'
  'sting, and the grave its victory. On Saturday morning, 18th,\n'
  'he read the newspapers, and carried on a pretty long conversation\n'
  'with Dr. Mead. His senses and faculties were then strong and\n'
  "vigorous ; but at six o'clock, the same evening, he became insen-\n"
  'sible ; and in this state he continued during the whole of Sunday,\n'
  'and till Monday, the 20th, when he expired, between one and\n'
  "two o'clock in the morning, in the eighty-fifth year of his age.\n"
  '\n'
  'And these were the last days of Isaac Newton. Thus closed\n'
  "the career of one of earth's greatest and best men. His mission\n"
  'was fulfilled. Unto the Giver, in many-fold addition, the talents\n'
  'were returned. While it was yet day he had worked; and for\n'
  'the night that quickly cometh he was not unprepared. Full of\n'

  '\n'
  'years, and full of honours, the heaven-sent was recalled; and, in\n'
  'the confidence of a " certain hope," peacefully he passed away\n'
  'into the silent depths of Eternity.\n'
  '\n'
  'His body was placed in Westminster Abbey, with the state\n'
  'and ceremonial that usually attended the interment of the most\n'
  'distinguished. In 1731, his relatives, the inheritors of his personal\n'
  'estate, erected a monument to his memory in the most conspicu-\n'
  'cus part of the Abbey, which had often been refused by the dean\n'
  "and chapter to the greatest of England's nobility. During the\n"
  'same year a medal was struck at the Tower in his honour ; and,\n'
  'in 1755, a full-length statue of him, in white marble, admirably\n'
  'executed, by Roubiliac, at the expense of Dr. Robert Smith, was\n'
  'erected in the ante-chamber of Trinity College, Cambridge.\n'
  'There is a painting executed in the glass of one of the windows\n'
  'of the same college, made pursuant to the will of Dr. Smith, who\n'
  'left five hundred pounds for that purpose.\n'
  '\n'
  'Newton left a personal estate of about thirty-two thousand\n'
  'pounds. It was divided among his four nephews and four nieces\n'
  'of the half blood, the grand-children of his mother, by the Reve-\n'
  'rend Mr. Smith. The family estates of Woolsthorpe and Sustern\n'
  'fell to John Newton, the heir-at-law, whose great grand-father\n'
  "was Sir Isaac's uncle. Before his death he made an equitable\n"
  'distribution of his two other estates: the one in Berkshire to the\n'
  'sons and daughter of a brother of Mrs. Conduit ; and the other,\n'
  'at Kensington, to Catharine, the only daughter of Mr. Conduit,\n'
  'and who afterward became Viscountess Lymington. Mr. Con-\n'
  'duit succeeded to the offices of the Mint, the duties of which he\n'
  "had discharged during the last two years of Sir Isaac's life.\n"

  "Our author's works are found in the collection of Castilion,\n"

  'also published Bern. Varenii Geographia, &c., 1681, 8vo.\n'
  'There are, however, numerous manuscripts, letters, and other\n'
  'papers, which have never been given to the world: these are\n'

  'The manor-house, at Woolsthorpe, was visited by Dr. Stuke\n'
  'ley, in October, 1721, who, in a letter to Dr. Mead, written in\n'
  '1727, gave the following description of it :- " "T\'is built of stone,\n'
  'as is the way of the country hereabouts, and a reasonably good\n'
  "one. They led me up stairs and showed me Sir Isaac's study,\n"
  'where I supposed he studied, when in the country, in his younger\n'
  'days, or perhaps when he visited his mother from the University.\n'
  'I observed the shelves were of his own making, being pieces of\n'
  'deal boxes, which probably he sent his books and clothes down\n'
  'in on those occasions. There were, some years ago, two or three\n'
  'hundred books in it of his father-in-law, Mr. Smith, which Sır\n'
  'Isaac gave to Dr. Newton, of our town." The celebrated apple-\n'
  'tree, the fall of one of the apples of which is said to have turned\n'
  'the attention of Newton to the subject of gravity, was destroyed\n'
  'by the wind about twenty years ago; but it has been preserved\n'
  'in the form of a chair. The house itself has been protected with\n'
  'religious care. It was repaired in 1798, and a tablet of white\n'
  'marble put up in the room where our author was born, with the\n'

  'turned. The more immediate affairs of the farm received no\n'
  'better attention. In fact, his passion for study grew daily more\n'
  'absorbing, and his dislike for every other occupation more in-\n'
  'tense. His mother, therefore, wisely resolved to give him all the\n'
  'advantages which an education could confer. He was sent back\n'
  'to Grantham school, where he remained for some months in busy\n'
  'preparation for his academical studies. At the recommendation\n'
  'of one of his uncles, who had himself studied at Trinity College,\n'
  'Cambridge, Newton proceeded thither, and was duly admitted,\n'
  'on the 5th day of June 1660, in the eighteenth year of his age.\n'
  '\n'
  'The eager student had now entered upon a new and wider\n'
  'field ; and we find him devoting himself to the pursuit of know-\n'
  'ledge with amazing ardour and perseverance. Among other sub-\n'
  'jects, his attention was soon drawn to that of Judicial Astrology\n'
  'He exposed the folly of this pseudo-science by erecting a figure\n'
  'with the aid of one or two of the problems of Euclid ;- and thus\n'
  'began his study of the Mathematics. His researches into this\n'
  'science were prosecuted with unparallelled vigour and success.\n'
  'Regarding the propositions contained in Euclid as self-evident\n'
  'truths, he passed rapidly over this ancient system-a step which\n'
  'he afterward much regretted-and mastered, without further pre-\n'
  "paratory study, the Analytical Geometry of Descartes. Wallis's\n"
  "Arithmetic of Infinites, Saunderson's Logic, and the Optics of\n"
  'Kepler, he also studied with great care; writing upon them\n'
  "many comments ; and, in these notes on Wallis's work was un-\n"
  'doubtedly the germ of his fluxionary calculus. His progress was\n'
  'so great that he found himself more profoundly versed than his tutor\n'
  'in many branches of learning. Yet his acquisitions were not\n'
  'gotten with the rapidity of intuition ; but they were thoroughly\n'
  'made and firmly secured. Quickness of apprehension, or intel\n'
  'lectual nimbleness did not belong to him. He saw too far : his.\n'
  'insight was too deep. He dwelt fully, cautiously upon the least\n'
  'subject ; while to the consideration of the greatest, he brought a\n'
  'massive strength joined with a matchless clearness, that, regard-\n'
  'less of the merely trivial or unimportant, bore with unerring sa-\n'
  'gacity upon the prominences of the subject, and, grappling with\n'
  'its difficulties, rarely failed to surmount them.\n'

  'His early and fast friend, Dr. Barrow-in compass of inven-\n'
  'tion only inferior to Newton-who had been elected Professor\n'
  'of Greek in the University, in 1660, was made Lucasian Profes-\n'
  'sor of Mathematics in 1663, and soon afterward delivered his\n'
  'Optical Lectures : the manuscripts of these were revised by New-\n'
  'ton, and several oversights corrected, and many important sug-\n'
  'gestions made by him ; but they were not published till 1669.\n'
  '\n'
  'In the year 1665, he received the degree of Bachelor of Arts ;\n'
  'and, in 1666, he entered upon those brilliant and imposing dis-\n'
  'coveries which have conferred inappreciable benefits upon science,\n'
  'and immortality upon his own name.\n'
  '\n'
  'Newton, himself, states that he was in possession of his Method\n'
  'of Fluxions, " in the year 1666, or before." Infinite quantities\n'
  'had long been a subject of profound investigation ; among the\n'
  'ancients by Archimedes, and Pappus of Alexandria ; among the\n'
  'moderns by Kepler, Cavaleri, Roberval, Fermat and Wallis.\n'
  'With consummate ability Dr. Wallis had improved upon the la-\n'
  'bours of his predecessors : with a higher power, Newton moved\n'
  'forwards from where Wallis stopped. Our author first invented\n'
  'his celebrated BINOMIAL THEOREM. And then, applying this\n'
  'Theorem to the rectification of curves, and to the determination\n'
  'of the surfaces and contents of solids, and the position of their\n'
  'centres of gravity, he discovered the general principle of deducing\n'
  'the areas of curves from the ordinate, by considering the area as\n'
  'a nascent quantity, increasing by continual fluxion in the propor-\n'
  'tion of the length of the ordinate, and supposing the abscissa\n'
  'to increase uniformly in proportion to the time. Regarding lines\n'
  'as generated by the motion of points, surfaces by the motion of\n'
  'lines, and solids by the motion of surfaces, and considering that.\n'
  'the ordinates, abscissae, &c., of curves thus formed, vary accord-\n'
  'ing to a regular law depending on the equation of the curve,\n'
  'he deduced from this equation the velocities with which these\n'
  'quantities are generated, and obtained by the rules of infinite\n'
  'series, the ultimate value required. To the velocities with which\n'
  'every line or quantity is generated, he gave the name of FLUX-\n'
  'IONS, and to the lines or quantities themselves, that of FLUENTS.\n'

  'intellects :-- that, variously modified, has proved of incalculable\n'
  'service in aiding to develope the most abstruse and the highest\n'
  'truths in Mathematics and Astronomy : and that was of itself\n'
  'enough to render any name illustrious in the crowded Annals of\n'
  'Science.\n'
  '\n'
  'At this period, the most distinguished philosophers were direct-\n'
  'ing all their energies to the subject of light and the improvement\n'
  'of the refracting telescope. Newton, having applied himself to\n'
  'the grinding of "optic glasses of other figures than spherical," ex-\n'
  'perienced the impracticability of executing such lenses ; and con-\n'
  'jectured that their defects, and consequently those of refracting\n'
  'telescopes, might arise from some other cause than the imperfect\n'
  'convergency of rays to a single point. He accordingly "procured\n'
  'a triangular glass prism to try therewith the celebrated phenom-\n'
  'ena of colours." His experiments, entered upon with zeal, and\n'
  'conducted with that industry, accuracy, and patient thought, for\n'
  'which he was so remarkable, resulted in the grand conclusion,\n'
  'that LIGHT WAS NOT HOMOGENEOUS, BUT CONSISTED OF RAYS,\n'
  'SOME OF WHICH WERE MORE REFRANGIBLE THAN OTHERS. This\n'
  'profound and beautiful discovery opened up a new era in the\n'
  'History of Optics. As bearing, however, directly upon the construc-\n'
  'tion of telescopes, he saw that a lens refracting exactly like a prism\n'
  'would necessarily bring the different rays to different foci, at\n'
  'different distances from the glass, confusing and rendering the\n'
  'vision indistinct. Taking for granted that all bodies produced\n'
  'spectra of · qual length, he dismissed all further consideration of\n'
  'the refracting instrument, and took up the principle of reflection.\n'
  'Rays of all colours, he found, were reflected regularly, so that the\n'
  'angle of reflection was equal to the angle of incidence, and hence\n'
  'he concluded that optical instruments might be brought to any\n'
  'degree of perfection imaginable, provided reflecting specula of\n'
  'the requisite figure and finish could be obtained. At this stage\n'
  'of his optical researches, he was forced to leave Cambridge on\n'
  'account of the plague which was then desolating England.\n'
  '\n'
  'He retired to Woolsthorpe. ',
  'Its\n'
  'publication seemed to infuse additional bitterness into the feelings\n'
  'of Leibnitz, who descended to unfounded charges and empty\n'
  'threats. He had been privy counsellor to the Elector of Han-\n'
  'over, before that prince was elevated to the British throne ; and\n'
  'in his correspondence, in 1715 and 1716, with the Abbé Conti,\n'
  'then at the court of George I., and with Caroline, Princess of\n'
  'Wales, he attacked the doctrines of the PRINCIPIA, and indirectly\n'
  'its author, in a manner very discreditable to himself, both as a\n'
  'learned and as an honourable man. His assaults, however, were\n'
  'triumphantly met ; and, to the complete overthrow of his rival\n'
  'pretensions, Newton was induced to give the finishing blow. The\n'
  'verdict is universal and irreversible that the English preceded\n'
  'the German philosopher, by at least ten years, in the invention\n'
  'of fluxions. Newton could not have borrowed from Leibnitz ;\n'
  'but Leibnitz might have borrowed from Newton. A new edition\n'
  'of the Commercium Epistolicum was published in 1722-5 (?) ; but\n'
  'neither in this, nor in the former edition, did our author take any\n'
  'part. The disciples, enthusiastic, capable and ready, effectually\n'
  'shielded, with the buckler of Truth, the character of the Master,\n'
  'whose own conduct throughout was replete with delicacy, dignity\n'
  'and justice. He kept aloof from the controversy-in which Dr.\n'
  'Keill stood forth as the chief representative of the Newtonian\n'
  'side-till the very last, when, for the satisfaction of the King,\n'
  'George I., rather than for his own, he consented to put forth his\n'

  'basis.\n'
  '\n'
  'A petition to have inventions for promoting the discovery of the\n'
  'longitude at sea, suitably rewarded, was presented to the House\n'
  'of Commons, in 1714. A committee, having been appointed to\n'
  'investigate the subject, called upon Newton and others for their\n'
  'opinions. That of our author was given in writing. A report,\n'
  'favourable to the desired measure, was then taken up, and a bill\n'
  'for its adoption subsequently passed.\n'
  '\n'
  'On the ascension of George I., in 1714, Newton became an\n'
  'object of profound interest at court. His position under govern-\n'
  'ment, his surpassing fame, his spotless character, and, above all,\n'
  'his deep and consistent piety, attracted the reverent regard of the\n'
  'Princess of Wales, afterward queen-consort to George II. She\n'
  'was a woman of a highly cultivated mind, and derived the greatest\n'
  'pleasure from conversing with Newton and corresponding with\n'
  'Leibnitz. One day, in conversation with her, our author men-\n'
  'tioned and explained a new system of chronology, which he had\n'
  'composed at Cambridge, where he had been in the habit " of\n'
  'refreshing himself with history and chronology, when he was\n'
  'weary with other studies." Subsequently, in the year 1718, she\n'
  'requested a copy of this interesting and ingenious work. Newton.\n'
  'accordingly, drew up an abstract of the system from the separate\n'
  'papers in which it existed, and gave it to her on condition that it\n'
  'should not be communicated to any other person. Sometime\n'
  'afterward she requested that the Abbé Conti might be allowed\n'
  'to have a copy of it. The author consented: and the abbé\n'
  'received a copy of the manuscript, under the like injunction and\n'
  'promise of secrecy. This manuscript bore the title of " A short\n'
  'Chronicle, from the First Memory of Things in Europe, to the\n'
  'Conquest of Persia, by Alexander the Great."\n'
  '\n'
  'After Newton took up his residence in London, he lived in a\n'
  'style suited to his elevated position and rank. He kept his car-\n'
  'riage, with an establishment of three male and three female serv-\n'
  'ants. But to everything like vain show and luxury he was utterly\n'
  'averse. His household affairs, for the last twenty years of his\n'
  'life, were under the charge of his niece, Mrs. Catherine Barton,\n'

  'wife and widow of Colonel Barton-a woman of great beauty and\n'
  'accomplishment-and subsequently married to John Conduit, Esq.\n'
  'At home Newton was distinguished by that dignified and gentle\n'
  'hospitality which springs alone from true nobleness. On all pro-\n'
  'per occasions, he gave splendid entertainments, though without\n'
  'ostentation. In society, whether of the palace or the cottage,\n'
  'his manner was self-possessed and urbane; his look benign and\n'
  'affable ; his speech candid and modest ; his whole air undisturb-\n'
  'edly serene. He had none of what are usually called the singu-\n'
  'larities of genius ; suiting himself easily to every company-\n'
  'except that of the vicious and wicked; and speaking of himself\n'
  'and others, naturally, so as never even to be suspected of vanity.\n'
  'There was in him, if we may be allowed the expression, a WHOLE-\n'
  'NESS of nature, which did not admit of such imperfections and\n'
  'weakness-the circle was too perfect, the law too constant, and\n'
  'the disturbing forces too slight to suffer scarcely any of those\n'
  'eccentricities which so interrupt and mar the movements of many\n'
  'bright spirits, rendering their course through the world more like\n'
  'that of the blazing meteor than that of the light and life-impart-\n'
  'ing sun. In brief, the words GREATNESS and GOODNESS could\n'
  'not, humanly speaking, be more fitly employed than when applied\n'
  'as the pre-eminent characteristics of this pure, meek and vene-\n'
  'rable sage.\n'
  '\n'
  'In the eightieth year of his age, Newton was seized with\n'
  'symptoms of stone in the bladder. His disease was pronounced\n'
  'incurable. He succeeded, however, by means of a strict regimen,\n'
  'and other precautions, in alleviating his complaint, and procuring\n'
  'long intervals of ease. His diet, always frugal, was now extremely\n'
  'temperate, consisting chiefly of broth, vegetables, and fruit, with,\n'
  'now and then, a little butcher meat. He gave up the use of his\n'
  'carriage, and employed, in its stead, when he went out, a chair.\n'
  'All invitations to dinner were declined; and only small parties\n'
  'were received, occasionally, at his own house.\n'

  'In 1724 he wrote to the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, offering\n'

  'cause of ingenuity and learning, but in that of religion-in relieving\n'
  'the poor and assisting his relations, Newton annually expended\n'
  'large sums. He was generous and charitable almost to a fault.\n'
  'Those, he would often remark, who gave away nothing till they\n'
  'died, never gave at all. His wealth had become considerable by\n'
  'a prudent economy ; but he regarded money in no other light\n'
  'than as one of the means wherewith he had been intrusted to do\n'
  'good, and he faithfully employed it accordingly.\n'
  '\n'
  'He experienced, in spite of all his precautionary measures, a\n'
  'return of his complaint in the month of August, of the same year,\n'
  '1724, when he passed a stone the size of pea ; it came from him\n']]


["Newton defines the 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the "
 'velocity and quantity of matter conjunctly. This means that a body with '
 'double the quantity of matter and equal velocity will have double the '
 'motion, and with twice the velocity, it will have quadruple the motion.\n'
 '\n'
 "'Quantity of motion' is distinct from 'force' in that 'quantity of motion' "
 "is a measure of a body's movement (derived from its matter and velocity), "
 "whereas 'force' is something that *causes* or *resists* a change in a body's "
 'state of motion or rest.\n'
 '\n'
 "Here's how various forces are defined in contrast:\n"
 '*   **Vis insita (innate force or vis inertia):** This is a power of '
 'resisting inherent in matter, by which every body endeavors to persevere in '
 'its present state (either of rest or uniform motion in a straight line). It '
 "is exerted only when another force attempts to change a body's condition.\n"
 '*   **Impressed force:** This is an action exerted *upon* a body '
 'specifically to change its state of rest or motion. It only exists as long '
 'as the action is taking place.\n'
 '*   **Centripetal force:** This is a type of force that draws or impels '
 'bodies towards a central point, causing them to deviate from rectilinear '
 'motion and revolve in curvilinear orbits (e.g., gravity, magnetism).\n'
 '\n'
 "In summary, 'quantity of motion' describes the state of a body's ongoing "
 "movement, while 'force' describes what initiates, prevents, or alters that "
 'motion or state of rest.',
 "According to the context, Newton's *Principia* consists of three books. The "
 'first two, titled "OF THE MOTION OF BODIES," are "occupied with the laws and '
 'conditions of motions and forces." However, the text does not explicitly '
 'list or describe the three laws of motion themselves.\n'
 '\n'
 'Regarding their application in celestial mechanics, the text states that in '
 'the third book, titled "OF THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD," the constitution of the '
 'world system is deduced from the principles established in the first two '
 'books. This includes deriving the forces of gravity with which bodies tend '
 'to the sun and planets from celestial phenomena, and then, from these '
 'forces, deducing the motions of the planets, comets, the moon, and the sea. '
 'The principle of Universal Gravitation, which characterizes *The PRINCIPIA*, '
 "was deduced from the motion of the moon and Kepler's three laws, and was "
 'used to embrace in a "mighty generalization" the entire Solar System, '
 'explaining and harmonizing the movements of all its bodies—planets, '
 'satellites, and comets.',
 "The provided context does not detail how Newton derived Kepler's Second Law "
 '(equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation.\n'
 '\n'
 'Instead, it states that Newton **inferred** from "the first law of Kepler, '
 'namely, the proportionality of the areas to the times of their description," '
 'that "the force which retained the planet in its orbit was always directed '
 'to the sun." The text also mentions that Newton "by his greater law" '
 '(Universal Gravitation) "demonstrated to be true" the "three laws of '
 'Kepler," but it does not specify the method for the second law.',
 'Newton demonstrated that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of '
 'the distance between two masses by deducing this principle from the motion '
 'of the moon and the three laws of Kepler.\n'
 '\n'
 'Specifically:\n'
 '*   From the first law of Kepler (the proportionality of the areas to the '
 'times of their description), he inferred that the force which retained the '
 'planet in its orbit was always directed to the sun.\n'
 '*   From the second law of Kepler (that every planet moves in an ellipse '
 'with the sun in one of its foci), he drew the inference that the force by '
 'which the planet moves around that focus varies inversely as the square of '
 'its distance.\n'
 '*   He also demonstrated that a planet acted upon by such a force could not '
 'move in any other curve than a conic section.\n'
 '*   He showed that this force, or attracting, gravitating power, resided in '
 'every, the least particle, but in spherical masses, it operated as if '
 'confined to their centers.\n'
 '*   He verified its truth by comparing the motions of terrestrial bodies '
 'with those of the moon and other secondary orbs. He compared the space '
 "through which heavy bodies fall at the Earth's surface with the space "
 'through which the moon falls, as it were, to the Earth in the same time '
 'while revolving in a circular orbit, considering that the strength of this '
 'power must decrease in the duplicate proportion of the increase of distance.',
 "Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses "
 'universally is based on observations and a rule of experimental philosophy.\n'
 '\n'
 'According to "Rule III," qualities of bodies that are known to us by '
 'experiments and universally agree with those experiments are to be held as '
 'universal qualities of all bodies whatsoever.\n'
 '\n'
 'Applying this rule to gravity:\n'
 '*   It universally appears by experiments and astronomical observations that '
 'all bodies about the Earth gravitate towards the Earth in proportion to the '
 'quantity of matter they contain.\n'
 '*   The Moon likewise gravitates towards the Earth according to its quantity '
 'of matter.\n'
 '*   The sea gravitates towards the Moon.\n'
 '*   All the planets mutually gravitate one towards another.\n'
 '*   Comets similarly gravitate towards the sun.\n'
 '\n'
 'Therefore, in consequence of this rule and these widespread observations, it '
 'must be universally accepted that all bodies whatsoever are endowed with a '
 'principle of mutual gravitation. The force of gravity also resides in '
 '"every, the least particle" of matter, acting proportionally to the quantity '
 'of matter.',
 'Newton explains the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets '
 'primarily through their mutual gravitational attractions.\n'
 '\n'
 'Specifically:\n'
 '1.  **Mutual Actions**: Inequalities in planetary orbits arise from the '
 'mutual actions of the planets and comets in their revolutions.\n'
 '2.  **Differential Gravitation**: When three bodies (e.g., Sun, Jupiter, '
 'Saturn) mutually attract each other, the differential accelerative forces of '
 'gravity can disturb an orbit. For instance, the difference between the '
 'forces of gravity of the sun towards Saturn and of Jupiter towards Saturn is '
 "proportional to Saturn's power to disturb Jupiter's motion, causing a "
 'perturbation. The orbit of the Earth is also sensibly disturbed by the '
 'Moon.\n'
 '3.  **Components of Perturbing Force (Three-Body Problem)**: For a smaller '
 'body (P) orbiting a larger body (T), perturbed by a third body (S), the '
 'attraction from the third body (S) on the smaller body (P) can be resolved '
 'into two forces:\n'
 '    *   One force (LM) tends towards the central body (T). While it adds to '
 'the attraction towards T, it is not inversely proportional to the square of '
 'the distance from T, causing the orbit to deviate from a perfect ellipse.\n'
 '    *   The other force (SM) acts parallel to the line connecting the '
 'central body (T) and the perturbing body (S). This force is not directed '
 'from P to T, which causes the areas described by the radius from P to T to '
 'no longer be proportional to the times, and further increases the deviation '
 'from an elliptical path.\n'
 '4.  **Minimizing Perturbation**: The areas described are most proportional '
 'to the times, and the orbit approaches nearest to an elliptical figure, when '
 'this "third force" (SM) is as small as possible.\n'
 '5.  **Effect of Common Acceleration**: If the accelerative attractions of '
 'both the central body (T) and the orbiting body (P) towards the perturbing '
 'body (S) are equal and in parallel directions, they would not change their '
 'relative situation. However, if these attractions are unequal, the '
 'difference in attraction between them is what causes the perturbation in the '
 "orbiting body's motion.",
 'In the Principia, Newton utilized mathematical tools that served as '
 'precursors to what is now known as calculus, which he referred to as the '
 '"method of fluxions." The fundamental principle of his fluxionary calculus '
 'was presented in the second Lemma of the second book. The foundation of this '
 'general method is described through the concept of "moments," which he '
 'defined as the "just nascent principles of finite magnitudes," or '
 'alternatively, as "the velocities of the increments and decrements (which '
 'may also be called the motions, mutations, and fluxions of quantities)." He '
 'demonstrated how to calculate these moments for various quantities, such as '
 'products and powers (e.g., the moment of A^n is naA^(n-1)). His method was '
 'also interwoven with "working in equations, by reducing them to infinite '
 'series," a technique he had previously composed a treatise on in 1671.\n'
 '\n'
 'Newton did not use what is considered standard calculus notation (like '
 "Leibnitz's 'd' mark) in the Principia. The Royal Society's report on the "
 'dispute between Newton and Leibnitz clarifies that "the differential method '
 'is one and the same with the method of fluxions, excepting the name and mode '
 'of notation; Mr. Leibnitz calling those quantities differences which Mr. '
 'Newton calls moments, or fluxions; and marking them with a letter d—a mark '
 'not used by Mr. Newton." Although the fundamental principle of his '
 'fluxionary calculus was introduced in the Principia, its specific "algorithm '
 'or notation did not appear till published in the second volume of Dr. '
 'Wallis\'s works, in 1693."\n'
 '\n'
 "Newton's general reluctance to publish his purely mathematical writings "
 'stemmed from his "repugnance to everything like contest or dispute" and his '
 '"extraordinary humility." He also "censured the handling of Geometrical '
 'subjects by Algebraical calculations" and expressed a preference for the '
 'Geometrical Method, which aligns with the way "moments" are presented in the '
 'Principia. This suggests he intentionally presented his mathematical '
 'concepts in a more geometrical framework rather than a formalized algebraic '
 'notation.',
 'Newton explained orbital motion by proposing the principle of Universal '
 'Gravitation, which acts as a centripetal force. He deduced this principle '
 "from the observed motion of the moon and Kepler's three laws of planetary "
 'motion.\n'
 '\n'
 "Here's how he used this concept:\n"
 "1.  **Direction of Force:** From Kepler's first law (proportionality of "
 'areas to times), Newton inferred that the force retaining a planet in its '
 'orbit is always directed to the sun.\n'
 "2.  **Inverse Square Law:** From Kepler's second law (planets move in "
 'ellipses with the sun at one focus), he inferred that the force by which a '
 'planet moves around that focus varies inversely as the square of its '
 'distance from it.\n'
 '3.  **Conic Sections:** He demonstrated that a planet acted upon by such a '
 'force could only move in a conic section, explaining when an orbit would be '
 'circular, elliptical, parabolic, or hyperbolic.\n'
 '4.  **Nature of the Force (Universal Gravitation):** He demonstrated that '
 'this attracting, gravitating force resides in every particle, and in '
 'spherical masses, it operates as if confined to their centers. This means '
 'one body acts on another with a force directly proportional to the quantity '
 'of matter and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between '
 'their centers.\n'
 '5.  **Scope of Application:** Newton verified this universal law by applying '
 'it to the motions of terrestrial bodies, the moon, and other secondary orbs. '
 'He then generalized it to explain and harmonize all the movements within the '
 'entire Solar System, including planets, satellites, and comets.\n'
 '6.  **Observational Evidence:** The text notes that the revolutions of the '
 "moon, Jupiter's satellites, Saturn's satellites, Venus, Mercury, and the "
 'Earth about the sun, with their observed proportional areas and orbital '
 'characteristics, infer the existence of centripetal forces directed to their '
 'respective centers (Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, and the sun).',
 'Newton handles motion in resisting media by analyzing the resistance '
 'encountered by a moving body, such as a globe or cylinder. He considers '
 "several scenarios for the interaction between the body and the medium's "
 'particles:\n'
 '\n'
 '1.  **Perfectly Elastic Medium (Case 1)**: If the globe and the medium '
 'particles are perfectly elastic and reflect with utmost force, the '
 'resistance of the globe is to the force by which its whole motion may be '
 'destroyed or generated (in the time it describes two-thirds of its diameter '
 'uniformly) as the density of the medium to the density of the globe.\n'
 '2.  **No Reflection (Case 2)**: If the medium particles incident on the '
 'globe or cylinder are not reflected, the resistance is half as great as in '
 'the first case.\n'
 '3.  **Mean Force Reflection (Case 3)**: If the particles fly back with a '
 'certain mean force (neither greatest nor none), the resistance is in the '
 'same mean ratio between the resistance in the first and second cases.\n'
 '\n'
 '**Factors Affecting Resistance (for Globes)**:\n'
 '*   **Velocity**: The resistance of the globe, *cæteris paribus* (all other '
 'things being equal), is in the duplicate ratio of the velocity.\n'
 '*   **Diameter**: The resistance of the globe, *cæteris paribus*, is in the '
 'duplicate ratio of the diameter.\n'
 '*   **Medium Density**: The resistance of the globe, *cæteris paribus*, is '
 'as the density of the medium.\n'
 '*   **Compounded Ratio**: The resistance is in a ratio compounded of the '
 'duplicate ratio of the velocity, the duplicate ratio of the diameter, and '
 'the ratio of the density of the medium.\n'
 '\n'
 '**Mathematical Exposition of Motion and Resistance**:\n'
 'Motion in a resisting medium where resistance decreases in a duplicate ratio '
 'of the velocity can be expounded using a hyperbola. If AB is the time for '
 'the globe to lose its whole motion due to uniform resistance (BC being that '
 'motion), then in a resisting medium, the space described will be expounded '
 'by the area of a hyperbola (CBEF), and its motion at the end of time BE will '
 'be expounded by EF. The resistance at the end of that time is expounded by '
 'BH.\n'
 '\n'
 '**Types of Resisting Mediums**:\n'
 'Newton distinguishes between:\n'
 '*   **Mediums that are not continued (e.g., rare air)**: In these, '
 'resistance is as described above, dependent on whether particles are '
 'perfectly elastic (as in Case 1) or infinitely hard and void of reflecting '
 'force (resistance diminished by half).\n'
 '*   **Continued Mediums (e.g., water, hot oil, quicksilver)**: In these, the '
 'globe does not immediately strike all particles, but presses only adjacent '
 'particles, which then press others. In such mediums, the resistance is '
 'diminished by another half compared to the "infinitely hard and void of '
 'reflecting force" scenario. Specifically, a globe in these extremely fluid '
 'mediums meets with a resistance that is to the force by which its whole '
 'motion may be destroyed or generated (in the time it describes eight-third '
 'parts of its diameter) as the density of the medium to the density of the '
 'globe.\n'
 '\n'
 '**General Principles for Fluid Systems**:\n'
 'In Proposition XXXII and XXXIII, Newton extends these ideas to similar '
 'systems of bodies and fluids. He states that larger parts of systems are '
 'resisted in a ratio compounded of the duplicate ratio of their velocities, '
 'the duplicate ratio of their diameters, and the simple ratio of the density '
 'of the parts of the systems. This resistance arises from both '
 'centripetal/centrifugal forces between particles and from collisions and '
 'reflections. For a body moving very swiftly in an elastic fluid, the '
 "resistance is almost the same as if the fluid's parts were destitute of "
 'their centrifugal forces. The resistance of projectiles moving with '
 'extremely great celerities is not much diminished by the subtilty of the '
 'medium.',
 "Newton's notion of absolute space and time differs from relative motion in "
 'several fundamental ways, and this distinction is crucial for his physical '
 'laws.\n'
 '\n'
 '**Differences between Absolute and Relative:**\n'
 '\n'
 '*   **Time:**\n'
 '    *   **Absolute, true, and mathematical time** flows equably of itself, '
 'without regard to anything external, and is called duration.\n'
 '    *   **Relative, apparent, and common time** is a sensible and external '
 'measure of duration derived from motion (like hours, days, months), which '
 'may be accurate or unequable and is commonly used instead of true time.\n'
 '\n'
 '*   **Space:**\n'
 '    *   **Absolute space** remains always similar and immovable in its own '
 'nature, without regard to anything external.\n'
 '    *   **Relative space** is a movable dimension or measure of absolute '
 'space, determined by our senses through its position to bodies, and is often '
 'mistakenly taken for immovable space.\n'
 '\n'
 '*   **Place:**\n'
 '    *   **Absolute place** is a part of absolute space.\n'
 '    *   **Relative place** is a part of relative space, like a specific part '
 'of a ship for a body within it.\n'
 '\n'
 '*   **Motion:**\n'
 '    *   **Absolute motion** is the translation of a body from one absolute '
 'place to another. These are the "only absolute motions."\n'
 '    *   **Relative motion** is the translation from one relative place to '
 'another. For example, a sailor walking in a ship has relative motion to the '
 "ship but also partakes in the ship's true motion, and the Earth's true "
 'motion if it is moving.\n'
 '\n'
 '*   **Perception and Reality:**\n'
 '    *   Absolute quantities (time, space, motion) are not directly '
 'observable by our senses. The parts of immovable space, where true motions '
 'occur, do not come under sensory observation. Philosophically, one must '
 'abstract from senses to consider these true quantities.\n'
 '    *   Relative quantities are sensible measures or appearances. The text '
 'states that relative motions are "innumerable" and "altogether destitute of '
 'any real effect, any otherwise than they may perhaps partake of that one '
 'only true motion."\n'
 '\n'
 '**How this Distinction Supports his Laws (Properties, Causes, and '
 'Effects):**\n'
 '\n'
 'Newton argues that rest and motion, whether absolute or relative, can be '
 'distinguished by their properties, causes, and effects. This distinction is '
 'vital for a system of physics where forces cause real changes in motion.\n'
 '\n'
 '1.  **Properties:**\n'
 '    *   Bodies partaking in the motion of their encompassing wholes '
 'demonstrate true motion. For instance, if surrounding bodies move, those '
 'relatively at rest within them still partake of the true motion of the whole '
 '(e.g., the kernel moves with the shell). Absolute motion is determined by '
 'immovable places.\n'
 '\n'
 '2.  **Causes (Forces):**\n'
 '    *   **True motion** is *generated or altered only by a force impressed '
 'upon the body moved*. It always undergoes change from such a force.\n'
 '    *   **Relative motion** *can be generated or altered without any force '
 "impressed on the body itself*. It's sufficient to impress force on other "
 'bodies with which the first body is compared, changing their relation. '
 'Relative motion does not necessarily change from forces impressed on the '
 'moving body if similar forces are impressed on the reference bodies, '
 'preserving the relative position. This highlights that true forces act on '
 'bodies to produce true (absolute) changes in their state of motion, not '
 'merely changes in their appearance relative to an arbitrary frame.\n'
 '\n'
 '3.  **Effects (Centrifugal Forces in Circular Motion):**\n'
 '    *   This is the most powerful argument for distinguishing true motion. '
 'The "forces of receding from the axis of circular motion" (centrifugal '
 'forces) are a unique effect of **true and absolute circular motion**, not '
 'purely relative circular motion.\n'
 '    *   **The Rotating Bucket Experiment:** When a bucket filled with water '
 'is spun, initially the water is relatively at rest to the ground but moving '
 'relative to the bucket. At this point, its surface remains flat, showing no '
 '"endeavour to recede from the axis" (no centrifugal force). As the bucket '
 "gradually imparts its motion to the water, the water's *true* circular "
 'motion increases, and its surface becomes concave, ascending at the sides. '
 'This ascent is the "endeavour to recede from the axis," which directly '
 'measures the *true* and *absolute* circular motion of the water. Even when '
 'the water is relatively at rest *in the bucket* (spinning with it), its true '
 'circular motion is greatest, as evidenced by the maximal concavity.\n'
 '    *   This experiment shows that the "endeavour to recede from the axis" '
 "(a real physical effect) does not depend on the water's translation relative "
 'to ambient bodies but on its absolute circular motion.\n'
 '    *   Similarly, the tension in a cord connecting two globes revolving '
 'about their common center of gravity reveals their "endeavour to recede from '
 'the axis of their motion," allowing computation of their true circular '
 'motions.\n'
 '\n'
 'By demonstrating that true motion has distinct and measurable causes '
 '(impressed forces) and effects (like centrifugal forces) that are absent in '
 'purely relative motion, Newton establishes a framework where his laws, which '
 'describe how forces affect the *true* state of motion of bodies, can be '
 "universally applied and empirically verified, independent of observers' "
 'arbitrary frames of reference.',
 "The provided context states that Sir Isaac Newton's father was John Newton, "
 'but it does not mention the name of his grandfather.',

 '*   **Father:** John Newton, Lord of the Manor of Woolsthorpe.\n'
 '*   **Mother:** "The widow Newton" (her given name is not mentioned in this '
 'context, but she is identified as his mother).\n'

 'Scotch extraction; the other, that they came originally from Newton, in '
 'Lancashire, and lived for a time at Westby, county of Lincoln.']
