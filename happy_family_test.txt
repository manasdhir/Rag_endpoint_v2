 '(Communication) specifies that "Every notice or communication to be given or '
 'made under this Policy shall be delivered in writing at the address of the '
 'Policy issuing office / Third Party Administrator as shown in the Schedule." '
 'This suggests that to update her last name, you would need to communicate '
