 'being informed of the grounds for arrest and being produced before a '
 'magistrate within twenty-four hours. It also details provisions for '
 'preventive detention, including communication of grounds and the right to '
 'make a representation. However, the context does not explicitly state '
 'whether an arrest without a warrant is legal or illegal.',
 'No, according to the provided text, no citizen shall be ineligible for, or '
 'discriminated against in respect of, any employment or office under the '
 'State on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of '
 'birth, or residence. This is stated in clause (2) of article 16, which is '
 'about equality of opportunity in matters of public employment.',
 'Based on the context provided, it suggests that laws for the acquisition of '
 'land by the State generally cannot be stopped or deemed void if they are for '
 'specific purposes such as:\n'
 '\n'
 '*   Acquisition of any estate or rights therein, or '
 'extinguishment/modification of such rights.\n'
 '*   Taking over management of property for a limited period in public '
 'interest or to secure proper management.\n'
 '*   Amalgamation of corporations in public interest or for proper '
 'management.\n'
 '*   Extinguishment or modification of rights of managing agents, directors, '
 'or voting rights of shareholders of corporations.\n'
 '*   Extinguishment or modification of rights related to searching for or '
 'winning minerals or mineral oil.\n'
 '\n'
 'Even if such laws are inconsistent with, or take away or abridge rights '
 'conferred by Article 14 or Article 19, they are not deemed void if they fall '
 'into these categories.\n'
 '\n'
 'Furthermore, if the law is made by a State Legislature, it needs the '
 "President's assent to apply under these provisions.\n"
 '\n'
 'Specifically, for land under personal cultivation within the ceiling limit, '
 'the State cannot acquire it unless the law provides for compensation at a '
 'rate not less than the market value. This implies that acquisition can '
 'proceed if compensation is provided.\n'
 '\n'
 'Additionally, certain Acts and Regulations, many of which relate to land '
 'reforms and acquisition, are listed in the Ninth Schedule and are explicitly '
 'validated (Article 31B), meaning they cannot be deemed void for being '
 'inconsistent with or abridging rights conferred by that Part of the '
 'Constitution.\n'
 '\n'
 'The context also states that laws made by autonomous regional and district '
 'councils regarding land cannot prevent the compulsory acquisition of any '
 'land for public purposes by the Government of the State concerned, provided '
 "it's in accordance with the law.\n"
 '\n'
 'Therefore, the provided text does not describe a mechanism to "stop" the '
 'government from taking your land if it is done under a law that falls within '
 'these protected categories or is validated by the Ninth Schedule, especially '
 "if it's for public purposes and, where applicable, provides for market value "
 'compensation.',
 'No, based on the provided text, if your child is forced to work in a '
 'factory, it is not legal.\n'
 '\n'
 'Article 24, under "Right against Exploitation," states that "No child below '
 'the age of fourteen years shall be employed to work in any factory or mine '
 'or engaged in any other hazardous employment."\n'
 '\n'
 'Additionally, Article 23 prohibits "Traffic in human beings and begar and '
 'other similar forms of forced labour," stating that "any contravention of '
 'this provision shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law."',
 'The Constitution of India, under Part III, Fundamental Rights, includes '
 '"Protection of certain rights regarding freedom of speech, etc." in Article '
 '19.\n'
 '\n'
 'However, the rights conferred by this Part can be subject to restrictions or '
 'suspension in certain circumstances, such as:\n'
 "*   Parliament's power to modify the rights for members of the Armed Forces, "
 'forces charged with maintaining public order, '
 'intelligence/counter-intelligence personnel, and telecommunication systems '
 'connected to these forces (Article 33).\n'
 '*   Restrictions when martial law is in force in any area (Article 34).\n'
 '*   The suspension of provisions of Article 19 during emergencies (Article '
 '358).',
 'Based on the provided context from THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA (Part III - '
 'Fundamental Rights):\n'
 '\n'
 'Article 25(1) states that "Subject to public order, morality and health and '
 'to the other provisions of this Part, all persons are equally entitled to '
 'freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and '
 'propagate religion." This implies an equal right to practice religion for '
 'all persons.\n'
 '\n'
 'Article 15 (Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, '
 'caste, sex or place of birth) prohibits any citizen from being subjected to '
 '"any disability, liability, restriction or condition with regard to... (b) '
 'the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of public resort '
 'maintained wholly or partly out of State funds or dedicated to the use of '
 'the general public" on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, or place '
 'of birth. While "religious place" is not explicitly mentioned, "places of '
 'public resort" could be interpreted to include public religious '
 'institutions.\n'
 '\n'
 'Furthermore, Article 25(2)(b) allows the State to make laws "providing for '
 'social welfare and reform or the throwing open of Hindu religious '
 'institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of Hindus." '
 'This indicates that the Constitution allows for laws to ensure access to '
 'public religious institutions for all sections.\n'
 '\n'
 'However, Article 26(b) also grants every religious denomination the right '
 '"to manage its own affairs in matters of religion," subject to public order, '
 'morality, and health.\n'
 '\n'
 'Considering that the freedom of religion in Article 25(1) is "Subject to... '
 'the other provisions of this Part" (which includes the prohibition against '
 "discrimination on grounds of sex), and the State's power to open public "
 'religious institutions for social welfare and reform, denying entry to a '
 'religious place based solely on being a woman, especially if it is a public '
 'institution, appears to be contrary to the principle of equal entitlement to '
 'profess and practice religion and the prohibition of discrimination on the '
 'basis of sex.',
 'Based on the provided text, Article 25, under "Right to Freedom of '
 'Religion," states that "all persons are equally entitled to freedom of '
 'conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate '
 'religion." This right is subject to public order, morality, and health, and '
 'to the other provisions of that Part.\n'
 '\n'
 'The text does not state that the government can stop you from changing your '
 'religion. "Freedom of conscience" implies the right to choose and change '
 "one's beliefs.",
 'Based on the provided context, if the police torture someone in custody, the '
 'right to "personal liberty" as protected under Article 21, "Protection of '
 'life and personal liberty," would be violated. This article states that "No '
 'person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to '
 'procedure established by law."',
 'The provided text indicates that the State is not prevented from making '
 'special provisions, by law, for the advancement of any socially and '
 'educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes or '
 'the Scheduled Tribes, in so far as such special provisions relate to their '
 'admission to educational institutions, including private educational '
 'institutions, whether aided or unaided by the State (other than minority '
 'educational institutions).\n'
 '\n'
 'This means the Constitution allows for the State to make provisions to '
 'facilitate your admission if you are from a backward community.']
